The gentle sounds of the little stream and chirping birds sound outside. The wind blew in through the open window and brushed my short, leafy hair, bringing a smile to my face. </span><span class="c3 c6">Another day... I wonder what it might bring</span><span class="c0">, I thought  as I sat up in bed. As I stretched in my bed I chuckled “Alright Deta.... time to get up!”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Throwing on my favorite light gray shirt and green pants, both made from scrat fur, I reached for my satchel, pulling it over my shoulder and checking to make sure the leaf-shaped flap was clamped shut. Our clan crest, the Celeste Randeth, glittered as the sun caught it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After getting ready, I left my room and headed to the kitchen to prepare breakfast. As I walked in that direction, I heard a soft voice calling. "Deta, how is your morning?" It was Vomete, my mother. Her long hair was made of vines and leaves, as all Randeths' hair was. She was made of stones and moss, with eyes of gold. Her demeanor was sweet, frail, and loving. Her voice was always soft and gentle, with a slight quiver to it, yet had a calming quality to it, like a soothing lullaby.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">         "Good to see you and welcome home! I'm doing fantastic of course. Did you have another long night?" I replied.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vomete smiled gently, as she had for many years before. "You know how it goes... One does not care for all of nature simply." With that, she walked to her chair in the meeting room, not far from the kitchen, her green robe fluttering. She sat down and scrubbed the dirt from her clothes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her reply brought a smile to my face, "That's true, but you do a wonderful job at it!" As I waved my hand over the windowsill garden, six carrots grew instantly, and I picked and prepared them. "A little dirty there, huh?" I continued preparing the food as we spoke.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vomete chuckled and said, "Even though we are one with nature, we don't need to be dirty," giving a small cough as her health was in decline as of late.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Very true," I replied with a smile, hoping to bring her some joy. "Alright, breakfast is ready—"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Out of the blue, we heard a knock on our door. We both stared at each other in confusion, as it was rare for anyone to venture this far into the forest. </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">She shook her head, then suggested, "Why don't you answer it, Deta?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As I walked to the door, I changed my appearance to look like a human. This is to conceal my identity as the appearance of my kind tends to frighten most travelers. My hand quivered as I reached for the door knob, wondering who in the world of Entine it could be. The apprehension quickly vanished when I saw a little human girl, about five years old, standing there. Her clothes hung in tatters, and her face was streaked with dirt and smeared with fresh cuts, each one a testament to her struggle. Her long brown hair was a tangled mess, matted with twigs and leaves that clung stubbornly to it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Concerned, I exclaimed, "Oh dear! Are you alright? Please come in!" The girl hesitated before slowly entering. "Let's get you cleaned up. Vomete, can you bathe her?" Vomete rose from her seat, causing the little girl to jump, thinking Vomete was a pile of rocks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Curious, I asked the girl, "How did you get so deep into the forest? It's not safe out there." I worried about what could have happened to her parents. Vomete and I often helped people leave the forest safely, as it was filled with dangerous creatures. Not only were there wolves in the woods, but mythical creatures such as the eagle-bear, Sklerps (a creature made of acidic ooze with metallic horns), Basilisk-folk </span><span class="c3">and other</span><span class="c3"> monsters. Without guidance,</span><span class="c3"> people</span><span class="c0"> could be seriously hurt.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The little girl answered me saying, "I was playing and got lost. I tried to find my way back but I fell down a hill. I haven't seen my momma in two days..."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c6">Two days?!</span><span class="c0"> I thought to myself, stunned. Eyes widened and mouth slightly agape. Trying to console her, I said, "Don't worry, little one. Go see Vomete and take a nice bath. I'll make you some food, and then we'll take you back home, alright?" I gave her a comforting smile, and the girl smiled back softly. "Okay, thank you, mister!" she said before running off to the back, where the sound of rushing water could be heard.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After some time, I managed to prepare something despite my limited knowledge gathered from human books. When the girl emerged, she was all clean and happy. Her long brown hair shone, and her cuts had been bandaged. Vomete followed her out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">With bright-eyed eagerness, she asked, "What are we eating?" I replied with a smile, "Well, I made some sugar rice!" Though I found it off putting, the child surprised me by eating it all.</span><span class="c3 c6"> Humans are strange,</span><span class="c0"> I thought. Vomete, on the other hand, smiled and praised me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">"You have made it well, my son." Happy to hear her approval, I chuckled and </span><span class="c3">reluctantly</span><span class="c3"> finished the weird human food. As we ate, Vomete asked the little girl for her name, “</span><span class="c2">Maggie!” She said with a smile and her cheeks full of food. We both chuckled at this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I then asked “So Maggie, can I ask you a question?” she nodded as she ate more food, then questioned her what sound a duck makes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">She thought for a moment and responded with “Quack?” with a tilt to her head. Vomete coughed and chuckled knowing this joke. Looking at Vomete confused, she looked at me as I smiled and mimicked a duck call. Maggie erupted in laughter as Vomete and I giggled and snickered. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After our meal, I slipped on my old brown shoes and said, "Alright, let's get you home." The little girl's energy brought a smile to my face as we made our way out the door.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We stepped outside, I gave Vomete a small hug Before I surveyed the front yard with a sweeping gaze. The small stream meandered lazily through the garden, its clear waters revealing darting fish that shimmered in the sunlight. Blossoms of every hue spilled across the flower garden, their vibrant colors mingling in a riotous dance of petals. The house, nestled snugly beneath the looming cliff, remained a secret from anyone peering down from above, its presence concealed by the rugged overhang.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Breathing in the fresh air, I exclaimed, "Ah, this is a beautiful day." Turning to Maggie , I asked, "Are you ready?" She seemed nervous, but I didn't blame her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Here, take my hand," I offered, extending my hand to her. "We can take the shortcut so we don't have to go through the scary part."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Her smile was warm as she reached out, her fingers gently closing around mine. Together, we strolled along a winding path, the crunch of gravel beneath our feet. Ahead, a stone archway emerged, its ancient stones draped in a lush cascade of green vines. I raised my hand, feeling the tingle of magic as my palm turned green, and exclaimed, "Exitum!", causing the vines to recede and the archway to reveal a portal beneath.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Maggie, taken aback by the sudden opening of the portal, let go of my hand, taking a few steps back. "Hey, it's okay. This will help us go to your mother," I reassured her. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">She looked with uncertainty at the portal, then back to me. "Okay..." Taking my hand once again, we walked through the portal.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Walking through the portal felt like a warm hug, comforting and peaceful. Emerging on the other side, we found ourselves in a field of grass and flowers. Maggie was mesmerized by the colorful blooms, and I couldn't help but chuckle. "Pretty, right?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">She nodded excitedly. "It's very pretty!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Pointing to a gray smudge in the distance, I explained to her, "And do you see that little gray bit over there? </span><span class="c5">That's the human kingdom.</span><span class="c5">"  </span><span class="c2">This was the most common place I would see humans go to after leaving the forest.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Her eyes sparkled with excitement. "Home!" she exclaimed, her grip on my hand loosening as she dashed ahead. Her infectious enthusiasm made my heart skip a beat, and I couldn’t help but sprint after her, laughter bubbling up and filling me with pure, joyful energy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As we walked, Maggie’s boundless energy began to wane. Eventually, she sank down amidst the flowers, her cheeks flushed from running. Looking at her with a gentle smile, I asked, "Are you tired?" She nodded, her voice soft but earnest. "Yeah... I ran so fast, and now my legs need a rest." I smiled back and replied, "Alright, let’s take a small break." We both settled into the soft bed of flowers, savoring the gentle warmth of the breeze and the soothing embrace of the sun.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">We sat in the field for about an hour when the little girl got up and turned her back to me. "What are you doing?" I asked, sitting up and looking at her. Turning around, she revealed a flower crown she had made.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5"> "Here! I made this for you!" She promptly placed it on my head, and we both giggled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Alright, let's get going, hm? Your mother is waiting," I said, smiling. "Okay, mister!" She replied, grinning from ear to ear.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As we approached the kingdom gates, Maggie had gotten tired so I picked her up to give her a rest and she fell asleep in my arms. I continued to walk late into the afternoon. "Hey, little one... time to wake up," I said softly. She groggily opened her eyes and exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Home!" Eager to get down, she squirmed in my arms. "Hold on, wait a sec. I'll put you down," I chuckled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Setting Maggie down, we approached the gates, where two stern guards in red tinted armor adorned with the kingdom’s lion crest stood. Their faces were hard and unyielding, etched with lines of stern discipline and disdain. One guard's eyes were narrow slits, glaring at us with a mix of suspicion and contempt, while his thick brows furrowed into a permanent scowl. The other’s face was set in a grim, unrelenting expression, his jaw clenched tightly as if daring anyone to challenge his authority. Their stern, unblinking states seemed to pierce through any pretense of civility.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Hold your ground! Stay where you are!" one of them barked, his voice a harsh command that brooked no argument.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I tried to reason with them, "Uh, gentlemen... I don't mean any harm. I just came to help—" But before I could finish, the guards began closing in, their faces unchanging and menacing. One moved deliberately from the left, his glare fixed on me with unwavering hostility, while the other advanced from the right, his expression a cold mask of authority. "What? Wait! Hey, this isn't right!" I protested, but one guard abruptly jabbed the tip of his spear to my throat, his eyes a chilling mix of anger and indifference. "Quiet! Or you'll die where you stand, criminal!" he growled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Swallowing my fear, I complied, my heart racing as I followed them, Maggie clinging to my side, her eyes wide with worry.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As we walked through the bustling town, I could feel the weight of curious gazes pressing on us. Whispers fluttered like restless birds around us, but their voices were lost in the din of the crowded streets. My eyes were drawn to the curious steel contraptions clattering by, each one pulled by horses and rattling with a noise that clashed with the smooth hum of magic and the lush greenery I was used to.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Our journey led us to an imposing castle, its grandeur striking against the cityscape. A maid came out alongside a knight and upon seeing Maggie, they snatched her up. While the maid embraced her, the other knight gave me a hard look of disdain. Walking in, tall pillars rose like sentinels, and </span><span class="c5">archways loomed</span><span class="c2"> high above, framing the grandeur of the structure. Inside, the air was cool and solemn. Statues lined the hallways, their stone eyes gazing down with a timeless, unspoken authority. At the end of the grand hall, a raised platform held the council chamber. Nine figures sat in high-backed chairs, their robes cascading around them like waves of shadow. Among them, one cloaked figure stood in proximity to the regal couple seated on elaborate thrones. The King and Queen, were unmistakably the focal point of the room’s austere elegance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">The king's gaze cut through the room, his eyes cold and narrowed. His lips tightened into a thin line as he spoke,</span><span class="c2"> "What is the meaning of this?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">A man in a red robe stood up, he was on a pedestal just as high as the king’s throne. His face was flushed with anger "Do you not know we are in a meeting? This better be good or you will be stripped of your privileges!" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">I flinched at the sudden outburst, my heart pounding as the harsh words were directed at me and the knights.</span><span class="c5"> "My king!"</span><span class="c5"> One of the knights stammered</span><span class="c5"> as he tried to keep his composure. </span><span class="c5">"I greatly apologize for the intrusion, but we have captured this strange man outside the walls, and </span><span class="c5">he had the princess herself</span><span class="c2">!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">A collective gasp rippled through the room. The king’s eyes widened, </span><span class="c5">momentarily breaking from their sternness</span><span class="c2">. I then tried to plead my case to say I had no idea that the girl was the princess and was just trying to do the right thing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">"SILENCE!" The King roared, </span><span class="c5">and the room fell silent</span><span class="c2"> for a few moments before a human in a white cloak next to the king spoke up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">From her voice, I could tell it was a woman. "Sire... if I may." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The king nodded. "Of course, mage..."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The woman nodded and stood up revealing a staff as tall as her with a bright blue stone at its top "This, my king, is one of the mythical Randeths," she declared.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The men were incredulous, insisting that Randeths were nothing more than myths to delight children. The king cleared his throat, silencing them. "What brings you to this conclusion, Zula, for the man before us seems human to me?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">She smiled. "As you know, the Randeth are typically made of stones and moss, they are also made of wood, and other foliage, and typically use plant magic." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The man in the red cloak interrupted, "Yes, we know this, so how is this man a Randeth? He clearly is human!" The man continued to yell, “Furthermore, what does this have anything to do with the princess!”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">The Mage</span><span class="c2">, Zula, looked at him disdainfully. "Allow me to finish speaking, Modius" She then turned to the room as a whole. "Randeths will often protect forests and aid travelers to their homes when they become lost in their territory. They are peaceful and often take the form of humans or wildlife to seem less threatening. Observe."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">She extended her staff to me, the light blue stone at the end of it began to glow and I could feel my spell being countered and reverted to my original form for a moment. The room stared in awe. "The second he entered, I felt his presence, and Randeths would have no reason to kidnap a child."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">The Queen looked unamused. </span><span class="c5">"Guard. </span><span class="c5">You have said he has stolen my daughter.</span><span class="c5"> Yet we do not see her.</span><span class="c2"> " </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">The men began to murmur, and I saw the guard's nervous expression. "Apologies, my queen!" The maid from earlier then</span><span class="c5"> entered, holding </span><span class="c5">Maggie’s hand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Hi Momma!" she chirped with delight. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The Queen’s eyes softened, but the relief that flickered across her face seemed almost practiced, too polished. "Maggie... Did this man kidnap you?" Her voice was gentle, but there was a curious lack of urgency, as if the question was more a formality than a genuine concern. She clasped her hands loosely in her lap, a touch too casual for a mother who had feared the worst. Maggie started to explain, but the Queen’s warm smile lacked depth, her eyes flicking to me before resting on her daughter with a serene, almost detached expression.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">When she finished, Modius spoke again. "He could have placed a spell over her! This could be the making of magic, to appear as though he was not guilty!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Zula silenced him with a glowing blue strap across his mouth. I looked at her staff, and the crystal on top was glowing. "If there was magic on her, council member </span><span class="c5">Modius</span><span class="c2">, it would have disappeared. I have made sure that all magic is disabled upon entering here. After all that was your request."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Modius’ voice cut through the tension, his brow furrowed in confusion. “Why didn’t you just dispel the illusion?” he asked, his tone sharp with suspicion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">She looked at him, her lips curling into a faint smile that hinted at a deeper understanding. “If I had,” she said, her voice steady, “you would have seen the truth, but your eyes would have refused to believe it. Whats real would have seemed more impossible than the illusion.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The Queen’s expression remained composed as she asked, "So... she is telling the truth?" Her voice was calm, almost measured.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The King inquired, "And this is a Randeth?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Zula nodded. "Yes. Your daughter is telling the truth, and this..." she pointed her staff at me, "is a Randeth from myths of old!" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">The men burst into conversation. As they did so I gave their confusion some thought. </span><span class="c5 c6">I</span><span class="c5"> </span><span class="c5 c6">guess it makes sense we seemed like a myth to them—Randeths lived so much longer than humans and don't normally interact aside from helping out of the woods. Vomete is over a myriad years old, which was old even for our standards…</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"It is settled then…" the King stated, as he turned to look at me.  "Sir, we apologize, for we know from our myths that Randeths are peaceful and we know that you mean no harm."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I chuckled, the sound coming out with a playful hiccup,</span><span class="c0"> "Well, I'm just glad everything worked out." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">This made the King </span><span class="c3">smile, all</span><span class="c0"> the sternness and hostility gone. "You have done me a great service, I would like to have you stay as a guest for dinner." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">"Really? Umm…" I scratched the back of my head. </span><span class="c3 c6">Vomete shouldn't be too mad if I stay for dinner, right? Not like anything will happen.</span><span class="c3"> "Well.. sounds good to me. </span><span class="c3">I would be honored to join you and your family for dinner</span><span class="c0">" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The King let out a rich, full-bodied laugh. "Good! Now.." He snapped his fingers and three maids came up to him and whispered something. He seemed to think about it then nodded. "See that he is properly cared for until dinner.." They bowed and walked away then the King turned to me and smiled. "Enjoy your stay. I will be seeing you later this evening."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Before I could respond, </span><span class="c3">the maids arrived</span><span class="c3">, each bringing their own distinct presence. </span><span class="c3">The tallest among them approached first</span><span class="c3">.</span><span class="c0"> “Come, sir,” she said, her voice calm and reassuring as she brushed back a strand of her long brown hair.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The second tallest offered a gentle nod, her short hair bobbing with her. “Let us show you to your room,” she added, her tone smooth and inviting.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The smallest and youngest looking maid, chimed in eagerly,  “Yes, please come.” The lighting hinted at a tinge of red in her hair as she spoke, her voice carried a surprising depth of sincerity.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">They spoke quickly and with voices similar to one another. Though they seemed pleasant, their smiles seemed a little too... sharp. As if it were unnatural for them to smile at this moment. I let out a nervous chuckle.   </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As we walked through the halls of the castle, our steps echoed around us. As my anxiety grew I tried to think of conversation. “So, uh… could I ask you three a question?” </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Without batting an eye the two shortest turned to me while now walking backwards and asked in unison what my question was. I gave an awkward smile and asked “So, back there with all those people… what was that all about?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The youngest spoke first, a </span><span class="c3">smile plastered</span><span class="c0"> across her face, “It is to represent the Council of Seven Gods that speak to the Ruler of the Heavens!” </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The next one picked up without a moment of silence “The different members of the council each represent something different with the color of their cloaks symbolizing them.” </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I tilted my head. “Cloak colors? What do you mean?” </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The oldest then responded, “You probably didn't notice when they were yelling at you, but here are the colors and what they represent: Life, Time, Wisdom, Energy, Spirit, Conflict and Guidance. Their colors are gold, brown, blue, green, silver, red and white respectively” </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The youngest nodded. “Yes, and the council members represent a corporal form of those! Nature, Architecture, History, Nutrition, Connections, War and Religion”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The second oldest then chimed in, “For instance, the council member over History would need to know everything about the past of the kingdom and share his knowledge with the King to prevent previous mistakes. The one representing Conflict makes sure all threats are eradicated. He was the one who kept yelling at you in court.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">At that point we had made it to a large green door, to which the oldest opened, revealing a lofty room. My desire to ask more questions soon dissipated as I looked into the room.  The space was grand, with towering walls that made the room feel both imposing and empty. The bed, with its ornate design, looked almost too perfect to be real.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">"Wow! This is amazing!" I looked around the room in awe, not sure how to process it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"We hope you enjoy your stay," the eldest maid said, adjusting her starched apron with a quick, practiced flick.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"We will be awaiting your requests," the second maid added, her voice carrying a faint hint of impatience as she fidgeted with the edge of her lacy cap.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"And will be waiting outside your room. Farewell," the third maid finished, her gaze lingering for a moment longer as she smoothed down her uniform. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As the three of them departed, I let out a long sigh of relief, the door clicked shut behind them. The faint smell of lavender and lemon zest lingered in the air, a testament to their meticulous attention to detail.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">"Oh thank goodness they are gone." Rock formed out of my arm and wood encased the other. "I didn't know how much longer I could hide these..." My hair then changed slowly back into vines and leaves. "Ah, much better..." I then thought back to the courtroom. "I'm impressed she knew what I was that fast.”</span><span class="c3 c6"> Even though she revealed my form I still felt the desire to hide my form until we left. Though I guess since I was caught, there isn't much use in hiding it now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I saw at the other end of the room a door and went to investigate to find it led to a bathroom made of </span><span class="c3">quartz and gold.</span><span class="c0"> "What in the world? This… is too much..." I left the bathroom alone and closed the door. "Well let's see... dinner isn't for many more hours so... I guess I could head into town?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I peeked out the front door of my room and saw the maids standing there </span><span class="c3">with no emotion at all</span><span class="c0">. As I tried to sneak past they all turned to me at the same time which caused me to jump "Ah!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Hello!" "Are you well?" "Where might you be off to?" They all had the same voice which was starting to become creepy. "Um, I was just going to head to town to look around-"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Let us accompany you." "Yes let's" "Yes." I already knew that there was no saying no. "Well.. alright... you want to show me around?" They all nod simultaneously and begin to lead the way.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">As we walked in town people began to whisper to which I could only assume they were taking notice of my arms and vines as I hadn’t bothered to recast my concealment spell</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The two older maids walked at my sides, their steps slightly out of sync. The first maid walked very composed, while scanning the surroundings with a sharp gaze. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The second kept glancing around anxiously, making sure we stayed together. Her eyes darted from me to the other two maids and back. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The last one from what I could tell was more void than the others, her expression almost seemed doll-like with her unwavering smile,  as she kept looking straight ahead.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">After walking </span><span class="c3">aimlessly</span><span class="c0"> for what seemed like hours, I asked hesitantly "So... where are you three taking me?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The first maid asked with a precise tone, "Where would you like to go?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The second maid nodded eagerly and added, "Yes, tell us."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The third </span><span class="c3">smiled,</span><span class="c0"> “We will take you there.” </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I thought the situation was incredibly awkward, but I glanced around and led the way into a building. The door creaked as it opened, revealing a dimly lit room filled with a thick haze of smoke and the raucous chatter of its patrons. The walls were lined with dark wood paneling, scarred from years of use, and the air was heavy with the scent of beer and unwashed bodies. Rough-hewn tables and mismatched chairs were scattered haphazardly across the floor, each one occupied by burly men engaged in animated conversations or laughter. The atmosphere was rowdy and rough, with a palpable tension that made me uneasy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I spotted an open table near the back, away from the main cluster of activity, and we made our way over. The table was grimy, the surface stained with who knows what, but it was a small refuge from the chaotic energy of the room. I turned to the maids, trying to mask my own discomfort with a reassuring smile.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Here, sit down," I said, gesturing to the chairs. The maids exchanged uneasy glances, their apprehension evident, but they took their seats. I could see the tension in their posture, their fingers fidgeting with their skirts as they tried to acclimate to the unwelcoming environment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">A few moments later, a burly man approached us with four large mugs of a yellow-orange liquid in his rough hands. His face was rugged, with a weathered complexion and a scruffy beard. His </span><span class="c3">eyes scanned</span><span class="c0"> us briefly before he plopped the mugs down on the table.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">"Uh... sir, we didn’t—" I began, attempting to clarify our order, but his glare cut me off. His </span><span class="c3">expression was a stern</span><span class="c0"> mask of impatience, and I realized he was in no mood for small talk.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">"Drink up," he muttered curtly before turning on his heel and lumbering back to the bar. The clinking of glass and the murmur of voices quickly filled the silence he left behind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I look at the drinks and then at the maids, "Umm.. are these for us?" They seemed confused and nodded, "Oh, well then. Let's drink up!" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">After our drinks were done </span><span class="c3">I </span><span class="c3">noticed the maid's faces were beet red and they seemed wobbly. I could not understand why, as I felt fine.</span><span class="c3"> I noticed</span><span class="c3"> a man walk our way. Right before he passed, I waved him over with my hand. "</span><span class="c3">Excuse</span><span class="c0"> me, is something wrong with them?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">He looked at the maids with confusion in his brow.</span><span class="c0"> "The King's maids? They are drunk,.. does the King have business with you?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">"Oh, well I'm supposed to be meeting with </span><span class="c3">him this</span><span class="c0"> evening." I chose not to mention that I was dining with the King and his family, as the people in this bar looked intimidating and I feared it might put me in danger. "What is being drunk?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">He rolled his eyes</span><span class="c0">. "Well, just don't let those maids get in trouble. Being drunk normally allows others to do… unholy things." He walked off.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"What? Unholy?" I turn to the maids "Are you three alright?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The three maids exchanged quick glances, the two older ones immediately putting on forced smiles. "Oh yes, we are fine! Perfectly fine," they said in unison, their voices unnaturally cheerful.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, the ginger-haired maid broke the facade, her eyes dropping to the ground as she hesitated. Her voice was softer, more vulnerable, as she admitted, "I feel hot... and dizzy."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">A wave of heat rolled through the room, thickening the air. Sweat beaded on foreheads, and people moved as if wading through molasses. I could feel the unnatural warmth seeping into my scalp, my leaves drooping and curling inward, losing their usual vibrant luster. </span><span class="c3 c8 c6">Was someone using magic?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The other two maids were shocked and exchanged worried looks. "</span><span class="c3">Rose</span><span class="c0">?" they asked in concern.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Rose?” I asked confused as I looked around expecting to see someone else at the table, but their gaze rested on the youngest maid. “Your name is Rose?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The redheaded maid blinked her eyes and rubbed them at the mention of that name and tried to reassure, "Oh, I'm fine! Perfectly fine!" The temperature began to return to normal, as she smiled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The other two maids then did the same thing before whispering to each other, "It seems the spell has been interrupted…We need to save Rose..." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c6">Did they say ‘spell’? Were they enchanted somehow? </span><span class="c3">I thought, my brow furrowed in confusion. </span><span class="c3 c6">Are they trying to keep her magic secret…?</span><span class="c3"> The maids had </span><span class="c3">spoken</span><span class="c0"> so softly that I almost didn’t hear it. I then interrupted, “Are you ladies sure you’re okay?” </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They each nodded, and Rose changed the subject, not realizing what the other two were talking about, "Oh! It's time to meet the </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">King! Follow us, sir!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">As we walked towards the castle, the two taller maids slowed down and walked beside me, their faces still red,trying to keep their balance. </span><span class="c3">Even</span><span class="c0"> though they kept telling me they were okay, the way they stumbled over their own feet told me otherwise. I opened my mouth to offer my assistance again, but before I could, the brunette maid pleaded with me, "Please sir... listen to us." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The eldest maid added, "We serve the King but are under the Queen's charge, and by her royal decree, no one is permitted to possess magic except those approved by the King." </span><span class="c0">They exchanged worried glances before speaking in hushed tones. "We have no magic of our own," she admitted, her voice barely above a whisper. "But Rose… she’s been showing signs." She glanced nervously at the youngest, whose fiery locks seemed to shimmer with a faint, untrained energy. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">"If the Queen ever finds out..." The second’s voice faltered, the unspoken words hanging heavy in the air. “Everyone knows the Queen's stance—uncontrolled magic was a threat to her power. To protect her throne, she wouldn’t hesitate to strip Rose of her emerging gift, publicly humiliate her, and then…” she gulped, “Execute her without mercy.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The brunette maid implored me to take Rose away from there if the King gave me a chance. I tried to ask why such an extreme measure would be taken. They explained to me that the Queen loves to exercise her power. T</span><span class="c3">he King would stop her </span><span class="c3">but he</span><span class="c3"> </span><span class="c3">doesn't</span><span class="c3"> know</span><span class="c0"> she does this. They then asked me again to take Rose away.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I was hesitant. "Uh... are you sure? How can you trust a stranger? I mean, </span><span class="c3">what if I'm a bad guy?</span><span class="c0">" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Please, sir..." they pleaded, their voices trembling with a mix of desperation and fear. The oldest maid's hands clutched the edge of her apron, knuckles white, while the younger one twisted a loose thread around her finger, eyes darting nervously “she isn't safe here." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just then, two guards approached us, their polished armor catching the flickering torch light from the corridor. Their voices, barely more than whispers, said, “The Queen has requested your presence in the King's dining hall.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The maids exchanged glances, their faces betraying a mix of curiosity and apprehension. The brunette maid, her expression clouded with something like quiet desperation, glanced back at me. Her eyes were filled with a silent plea, a hint of worry lingering in their depths before she and her companions turned and began to walk away, their footsteps echoing softly against the cold stone floor.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Sir, if you follow us, we will show you the way," one of the knights said, their voice steady and authoritative, though not unkind. I gave a nod of acknowledgement and fell into step behind them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The hallway we traversed was grand, its high ceiling adorned with intricate tapestries and the walls lined with ancient portraits of regal ancestors. As we approached the dining hall, the air grew warmer, filled with the scent of rich, roasted meats and fragrant herbs. The grand doors to the dining hall loomed before us, heavy and imposing, but they swung open effortlessly as the guards ushered us inside.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We entered a space that was nothing short of monumental—a room vast enough to host an entire army. Its grandeur was accentuated by the sheer simplicity of the furnishings: a single long table stretched down the center, surrounded by an array of high-backed chairs. At the far end of the table, the King, Queen, and the princess, Maggie, were seated in a commanding trio. Their presence was regal and imposing, a stark contrast to the otherwise unadorned room.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A few seats away, the mage, Zula, sat in quiet contemplation, her gaze fixed on some distant thought. The three maids from earlier stood in a discreet line near the Queen, their earlier composure replaced by a more formal and attentive demeanor. The youngest maid, the one who had glanced back at me with such concern, now stood with a careful poise, her eyes darting between the Queen and the other nobles.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The scene was set, the atmosphere charged with a palpable tension as we awaited whatever may occur.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The King welcomed us warmly, "Ah, there you are! Come, sit down!" He gestured towards a chair on the other side of the table from Zula, and I smiled and took a seat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Approaching the table, I noticed a thin man with an impressive bushy black mustache holding a scroll. </span><span class="c3 c6">Humans are quite amusing,</span><span class="c3"> I thought to myself, </span><span class="c3 c6">they hold high positions yet insist on growing their hair in such strange ways.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">After sitting down, I greeted the King and Queen with a smile and a respectful tone, "Thank you for inviting me to join you." </span><span class="c3">However, the Queen's demeanor </span><span class="c0">had changed. Now, she stared at me with palpable hostility, her eyes sharp and unyielding, brimming with a fierce aggression that was impossible to ignore. “Did I do something wrong?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Quite the contrary, you saved my daughter! Allowing you to dine with us is the least we could do. However, we do have something important to discuss." The King's smile was wide and sincere as he spoke. The man with the bushy mustache approached the King and handed him the scroll, which the King proceeded to open and place on the table.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">As I gazed at the scroll I saw it was a map of the catacombs. The King interrupted my thoughts with a question, </span><span class="c3">"Oh! I almost forgot, what is your name Randeth?" I realized I had not introduced myself and responded, "Oh, apologies. My name is Deta."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The room fell silent as everyone turned to look at me. "Did...I say something?" I asked, confused. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The King cleared his throat and shook his head, </span><span class="c3">"No, no. Deta, hm? Your parents must have been Detations?</span><span class="c0">" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Before I could ask what they were, the Queen interjected, "</span><span class="c3">It doesn't matter.</span><span class="c0"> Just tell him what you want, dear."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With a nervous chuckle, the King agreed "I suppose so. Deta, we would like to ask for your help. There is something immense lurking beneath our city, something stirring deep in the dungeon. The ground shakes at times, and the air feels heavy with its presence. We’ve sent soldiers below to investigate, but none have returned since their descent five moons ago. The creature, whatever it is, remains unseen.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Queen interjected, “Dear. We have our guardian down there, the serpent is probably hunting whatever it is that is bothering you, the knights simply got in the way.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The King smiled at his wife then turned to me. “Yes, but the season for when it wakes has long passed. Without it awake I fear things from beneath the land may be making their way to us. </span><span class="c3">Randet</span><span class="c0">h, would you please find it and drive it away?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">"Fight a monster?" I repeated in disbelief. The King explained, "Our Mage has informed us that your race has incredible magic abilities and we hoped that you could lend us your strength. Additionally, someone has stolen something precious from us and escaped down there. An amulet with fine carvings and a S</span><span class="c3">oul Stone</span><span class="c0">, It is incredibly-" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">My eyes widened in shock not hearing the rest of what he said. "A soul stone..? How did..." I murmured under my breath. </span><span class="c3 c6">A Soul Stone is what keeps my kind alive, its name being quite literal. If someone were to take it they could </span><span class="c3 c6">harness a Randeth's</span><span class="c3 c6"> powers… at the cost </span><span class="c3 c6">of the Randeth’s</span><span class="c3 c6"> life to which the soul belonged.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Interrupting my thoughts, the King sighed, "Of course, we understand if you cannot. You have already done a tremendous service by returning our daughter."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The princess then pleaded with me, "Can you help us, mister? Please?" Her innocent request and the knowledge of the soul stone at risk made it impossible for me to refuse. "Alright...I'll help," I said, smiling at Maggie.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The King was overjoyed, "Thank you, young Deta! Find those you want to take with you, and when you return, you and your party will be greatly rewarded!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He hesitated, his gaze shifting between the maids with a sense of growing unease. The request from the maids echoed in his mind, their voices soft but insistent, weaving a tapestry of obligation and concern. His eyes lingered on the ginger-haired maid, a tangle of apprehension and determination knotting in his chest.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A tight smile formed on his lips as he finally spoke, his voice a blend of formality and unspoken hope. "Of course, your majesty." He took a deep breath, the weight of his decision palpable. "Might I, for my first recruitment, ask for the ginger-haired maid?" He paused, the silence stretching painfully as he gauged their reactions, his heart pounding with the unspoken plea for understanding.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"And—" he added, his voice softening with earnest resolve, "it would greatly help me to have someone who knows the kingdom, to be able to find the rest of my party."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The room seemed to hold its breath, the tension thick with his silent hope and the potential for change.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Before the King could answer, the Queen interrupted, raising her voice. "You are choosing one of the princess's keepers to join your quest? How absurd!" </span><span class="c3">Her words cut through the air, sharp and deliberate, my mind struggling to catch up with the intensity of her message.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The King promptly stepped in to calm his belligerent wife. "Darling, it's alright. She has two others, and he is freeing our kingdom of something we cannot do on our own." He chuckled in an attempt to ease the tension.</span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Queen scoffed and turned away. "Do as you wish," she muttered under her breath.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Just as the King was about to speak again, a loud explosion echoed through the castle walls. "What was that?" </span><span class="c3">I </span><span class="c0">asked urgently, my voice slightly strained as I glanced around.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The King raised his hand and smiled,"No need to worry. We have our loyal knights on hand for these matters," he said, his tone carrying a practiced reassurance. I found myself relaxing, the knot of anxiety in my chest loosening. It was clear this was a routine he handled with ease.</span></p><hr/><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><h5 class="c9 c11" id="h.1fob9te"><span class="c5 c8 c45 c22"></span></h5><h5 class="c7 c23" id="h.3znysh7"><span class="c42"> </span><span class="c21">CHAPTER </span><span class="c21">2</span><span class="c32"> </span><span class="c13 c8">                                                                                                                         Wild Chase</span></h5><p class="c19 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16 c6">Beans’ </span><span class="c16 c8 c6 c14">View</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c5 c8 c6 c14"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">We heard an explosion in the town square. Bluma,</span><span class="c3"> the demon knight, and I, Beans, </span><span class="c3">were ready for action.</span><span class="c0"> Bluma wore a striking ensemble of bright red and gold armor that seemed to catch the light just right, drawing your eye to the fine details. The smooth red breastplate fit her form with an effortless grace, with delicate gold etchings that traced soft patterns down her arms and legs. Her pauldrons curved outward slightly, lined with gold that gleamed. There was something about the way it all came together—refined, powerful, and undeniably captivating, like the armor was made to reflect the confidence she carried. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her four golden eyes shone brightly against the deep black of her sclera. Cascading down her back was her fiery red hair which danced with every movement. Standing at an impressive seven feet tall, she was adorned with two smoky brown horns elegantly curving from her head, adding a majestic quality to her appearance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What sets her apart most dramatically is her face, which lacks both mouth and nose, resembling a festival mask in its purity and simplicity. Her visage is dominated solely by those mesmerizing eyes, creating a captivating aura. While this might be disconcerting to some, to me, it only enhances her enigmatic allure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">And I, a Dwarf and her squire, stood by her side.</span><span class="c3"> I have round blue eyes and scruffy blonde hair, with freckles scattered across my clean shaven face and down my arms. I'm in my mid forties which may seem old to humans but for a Dwarf I am a young adult.</span><span class="c3"> </span><span class="c3">We have been working together for seven years, and we knew each </span><span class="c3">other inside and out</span><span class="c0"> in more ways than one.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, a knight can never fall in love with their squire, that's something we keep secret, if anyone were to find out, we wouldn't be able to see each other again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I had just finished preparing Bluma's sword. </span><span class="c3">"Here you go, ma'am! Your sword is as sharp as an Entian's glare!</span><span class="c3">" I said, handing the sword to Bluma. It was made of a black metal that was almost indestructible called a </span><span class="c3">sklerp</span><span class="c3"> horn. </span><span class="c3">Legends say that a Randeth blessed a deer’s womb causing the sklerp to be born. </span><span class="c3"> Her sword had a golden handle and hilt with the kingdom's crest molded into its stump. It was an oddly light-weight sword but would never fail its handler when used correctly. Bluma had spent many years mastering it. She nodded and </span><span class="c3">patted my head</span><span class="c3">. We </span><span class="c3">have worked together for so long that we had developed an unspoken language, and knew each other's every move.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bluma put the sword into its sheath on her side, and the two ran out of the barracks and to the town square. There was chaos and confusion as the local inn and bar had been set ablaze. "Gather," Bluma said softly, and I saluted her. "Yes, ma'am!" I replied, knowing exactly what she meant.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Bluma darted into the inn, her eyes scanning the dim interior for anyone who might still be trapped. Meanwhile, </span><span class="c3">I</span><span class="c3"> wove through the frantic crowd outside, alongside the other knights and squires.  We gently guided panicked townsfolk away from the inn, our calm voices and firm hands working to stem the rising tide of chaos. As Bluma stepped inside, her eyes landed on the source of the chaos, one of them twitching involuntarily. An elvish bard—who had been explicitly told not to get drunk—had, predictably, gotten drunk. She could only assume he was once again the main culprit behind this outburst of propaganda. When intoxicated, his inability to control his powers was a frustratingly familiar issue. And since he was a frequent visitor to our kingdom, enforcing magic control laws on him proved nearly impossible.</span><span class="c0">She proceeded to walk over to the passed-out drunk and grab him by the scruff of his hair with one hand and, with the other, grasped onto his harp.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Bluma dragged the limp body out of the building, while some town mages came to extinguish the fire. Seeing her walk out of the flames unharmed was magical so I ran up to Bluma and upon seeing the sleeping drunk bard groaned and sighed,</span><span class="c3"> "Again? How many times till he learns to stop drinking? He should know he can't handle the alcohol."</span><span class="c0"> Bluma rolled her eyes and groaned with her lower two eyes looking at me and the other two gliding between the Elf and the jailblock. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">"Discipline," I said in agreement. I sighed then stated, "I suppose you're right. Maybe a few nights locked up will do him some good. I'll put this harp back into the barracks to prevent any more mishaps like last time." I </span><span class="c3">chuckled while Bluma shook her head.</span><span class="c0"> Kneeling down she handed the harp to me then as she was standing up she let her hand follow up my arm and fall off my shoulder with a small flick of her finger causing a rush to my face but I quickly composed myself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After dropping off the harp, I made my way to the castle. The towering stone walls loomed overhead, their surfaces worn smooth by time but still imposing. Ornate banners, bearing the kingdom’s crest, hung between the archways, their deep reds and golds a stark contrast to the cool gray stone. The scent of polished wood and burning torches filled the air as I stepped inside, my boots clicking softly against the gleaming floors.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The halls stretched endlessly before me, lined with tall windows that let in thin beams of morning light. Servants bustled about, their hurried footsteps echoing faintly, but none paid me any mind. I passed intricately carved wooden doors, each leading to unknown chambers filled with royal secrets I had no business knowing. My stomach twisted with unease, but I kept moving, my hands gripping the straps of my bag tightly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As I turned a corner, I spotted a man made of plants and one of the princess’s maids speaking with a guard. My heart lurched as the guard suddenly pointed in my direction. My breath hitched. The only time things like this happened was when foreign royalty visited.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c8 c6">Oh no.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">My pulse pounded in my ears</span><span class="c3 c8 c6">. Am I supposed to bow? Speak formally? What if he spoke another language? What if I said the wrong thing and insulted him? What if I was supposed to guide him somewhere? I didn't know how to do that! What if—what if he needed something important, something royal, and I messed it up?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">My hands were clammy, my legs stiff and useless as the two figures walked toward me. My thoughts spiraled further. </span><span class="c3 c6">What if this was a test? What if the princess was watching, and she expected me to handle this properly? Was I supposed to introduce myself? Could I just run? No, no, that would definitely be worse.</span><hr/></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c8 c6"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16 c8 c6 c17">Deta’s View</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c3 c8 c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Seeing the small squire, I smiled, hoping he could help us. "Hey there! Could you please help us with something?" I smiled again. "I was told you were a squire and could lead me to a strong knight!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3"> The squire stood a few feet away from us, clutching his bag as if someone might try to steal it. His mouth opened and closed as if he were trying to find the right words. When he opened again, this time taking in a deep breath, a high-pitched shrill echoed in the halls, the sound slowly growing louder until </span><span class="c3">it sounded like</span><span class="c0"> a choked burp, which echoed in the vastness of the room. I thought the man was screaming, until his face started turning a deep shade of red.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">“Are you-” I started to speak but the man </span><span class="c3">interrupted</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">“I am a knight!” He blurted, his face crimson. “Follow me!” He then dashed off before we could respond.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I looked at Rose a bit confused, and she too was lost so we decided to chase after the mysterious knight. “Hey! Wait up!” I called out in vain as he continued to run. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Rose and I </span><span class="c0">chased after the knight hoping to ask him for assistance in dealing with the beast below the kingdom. We followed him around a corner as he disappeared.. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Where could he have gone?” Rose asked anxiously, her brow furrowing as she scanned the area. Her hands fidgeted with the hem of her dress.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">“I don't know but we will find him! This is probably a test to see if we are worth his time!” </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Rose looked unsure, her gaze darting around as she shifted from one foot to the other. She didn’t say anything, but her uneasy stance said it all</span><span class="c0">, “Are you sure? Would a knight do that?” </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I shrugged not knowing. “Well, we will find out!” I smiled which made Rose roll her eyes but smile so and</span><span class="c3"> we went searching.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Rose and I had decided to split up to cover more ground. I tried to navigate through the bustling crowd, b</span><span class="c3">ut with everyone pushing and shoving, it was nearly impossible to search.</span><span class="c0"> This place was so new, I didn’t even know where to begin looking. I felt a knot of anxiety tightening in my chest. The mix of unfamiliar scents and the constant chatter of vendors made it hard to concentrate. My hands were slightly clammy, and I found myself gripping my bag more tightly than usual. The bustling environment was overwhelming, making it difficult to focus on anything specific. I glanced back to see where Rose had gone, but the mass of people made it impossible to pick her out. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Eventually, I caught sight of Rose through the sea of faces, her distinctive red hair barely visible above the crowd. I maneuvered through the busy streets, my eyes locked on that small glimpse of her, determined to close the distance</span><span class="c0">. After putting my hand on her shoulder she turned towards me and asked, “Any luck?” I sighed and shook my head. Just as we were about to give up and start looking for other help we heard a huge crash on the other end of the district.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As Rose and I hurried towards the commotion, I saw a couple of knights gathered around a cart crash and two men being dragged away by a knight. As we got closer I began to recognize the knight from before in the group, I approached him and asked, "Hey, what's going on? Is everything okay?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Oh yes! Everything is just fi—" but he stopped short when I realized he was the knight we were looking for. “Wait, you were the knight we were looking for! We finished your test!”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He raised an eyebrow unsure what we meant “What test?” </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I smiled “You know, how you had us chase you around town and-” But Rose cut me off.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Sorry to interrupt but, are you even a knight?” she asked, a little timid but direct. “I do find it odd a knight would run away from someone seeking aid. Especially that quick.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Embarrassed, Beans chuckled nervously and said, "Oh, no, sorry, I'm not actually a knight. </span><span class="c3">I'm just a squire to the great demon knight!</span><span class="c0">"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">It was then we saw a figure standing behind him. As my eyes slowly traveled upward, I noticed the deep red and gold-trimmed armor she wore, the colors too vivid, too alive, for something so terrifying. My breath caught as I reached their face—or what should have been a face. Instead, there were no features, just a smooth, mask-like surface with four intense, cold eyes, each with a golden sheen set against an eerie black background. Those eyes seemed to pierce right through me, as if they could see every hidden fear. A shiver ran down my spine, and an overwhelming sense of dread washed over me. My gaze drifted to the dark hilt of the sword under their hand, the smoky brown horns on their head adding to the menacing aura that surrounded them, making every second feel heavier, like the air itself was thick with danger.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Realizing my mistake, I said, "Oh, I see. Sorry about that. We just wanted to ask if you could help us. We're in search of a knight, and we were told you knew someone."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Bluma looked down at Beans and chuckled quietly. Beans could tell that Bluma was bound to tease him about that later. He then clarified that he wasn't a knight but a squire then gestured with his whole body to Bluma and said, "She's the strongest knight in the kingdom!" He smiled wide, while </span><span class="c3">Bluma just stared at us, her expression inscrutable</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Oh!" I then turned to the demon knight and asked, "May we ask you to join our group then? The Ki—" but before I could finish, she cut me off, "No." She turned away and started walking, which caught me off guard. "H-hey! Where are you going?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As I was going to go after her, Beans grabbed my arm firmly and brought me to a sudden stop. "Leave her be, please. She's loyal only to the Royal family and will only listen to their words.” Continuing he asked “What do you need a knight for? Don't you have many of your own?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I raised an eyebrow, and then Rose chimed in with a small chuckle, "He's not a prince, but is a guest to the kingdom. A Randeth no less."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beans was taken aback and released Deta's arm. "A Randeth? Aren't they just legends, like Entians?" he exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rose smiled and reassured him, "No, they're quite real and friendly."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I chuckled, feeling a bit flattered. "I try my best to be friendly, but I'm not a prince," I said. "The King has tasked me with putting together a team, so I-"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">But Beans interrupted me, putting his fist into his hand. "The King needs you to form a team? Alright,</span><span class="c3"> I'll tell Blu - er</span><span class="c0">, I mean the Demon Knight. I'm sure she'd love to join now that you have the King's charge!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I felt a rush of excitement. "Really? You mean it?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Beans nodded enthusiastically. </span><span class="c0">"Yep! Just give me a moment!" He exclaimed before running off to find the Demon Knight. As he disappeared, I turned to Rose. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Isn't this great, Rose?" I exclaimed, excitement bubbling up inside me. But then I noticed her cheeks turning pink, her eyes darting away from mine. She fidgeted slightly, her fingers twisting together. "Rose? Are you okay?" I asked, my voice softening as I tried to make sense of her sudden discomfort.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rose patted her face with her hands and shook her head. "Oh yes, I'm fine. I'm just not used to hearing my name," she explained. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I raised an eyebrow in surprise. "Really? Have you never been called by your name before? Not even by the other maids?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">She shook her head no</span><span class="c0">, “We typically aren't together and don't sleep in the same dorms. So it is rare for me to hear it” </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">This was strange for me to hear, however, I didn't dwell on it and instead, I smiled kindly. "</span><span class="c3">Well, get used to it because I plan on calling you by your first name often, Rose</span><span class="c0">."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Wonder filled Rose's eyes, and her face lit up with a bright smile, eyes sparkling with pure delight which made me smile. "I guess I will, </span><span class="c3">Deta,</span><span class="c0">" she said.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Just as I was about to speak again,</span><span class="c3"> someone shoved me to the side,</span><span class="c0"> causing me to lose my balance and fall over. "Excuse me!" The person exclaimed as they rushed past me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rose bent down and helped me up "Are you all right, sir!?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I stood up and brushed myself off. "Ya, ya I'm okay." I then smiled. "You know you can call me Deta right?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">She blushed slightly but nodded</span><span class="c0">. Just then, an anxious older gentleman ran up to us, visibly upset. "Please help me, that man stole my family's heirloom!" he pleaded.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My eyes widened and looked at the man running away to the older man, "Of course! We will get your heirloom back for you!" I then turned to my companion. "Let's go, Rose!" She nodded and we both ran off to catch the man.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The man ran quickly and looked behind him to see us chasing him</span><span class="c0"> then looked straight ahead again. Once he exited the kingdom's gates, he took a sharp left behind the pillar adjoining the gate to the kingdoms' outer wall. "We can't lose him!" I declared, trying to catch up to him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As I rounded the corner, the bustling noise of the market faded into a sharp, startling sound. A massive creature suddenly loomed before me, its powerful legs propelling it upwards. I stumbled back, momentarily disoriented. "Whoa there!" I blurted out, trying to steady myself. The creature, I soon realized, was a robust horse, and atop it was a man dressed in dark, worn clothing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before I could gather my thoughts or say anything more, the man let out a fierce shout. The horse, spurred by the sound, reared up on its hind legs and then surged forward, galloping swiftly across the open field. Dust billowed in their wake, and I could only watch as they disappeared into the distance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rose appeared beside me just as the man and horse became a distant blur. Her face fell as she took in the scene. “We can’t catch him, Deta…” she said quietly, her shoulders slumping in defeat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As we walked back into the city, I looked up and saw a strange building with horses inside. It looked like they were trapped yet free to roam. "Wait a minute," I said, "maybe we can still catch him." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rose looked at me, doubting. "How?" she asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I smiled and approached the nearest horse.Rose looked confused as I walked towards the stable. "Hey there!" I greeted the horse with a smile.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The horse rolled its eyes and turned away. "Oh goodie, another </span><span class="c3">peasant</span><span class="c0"> wishing to ride one of us. Go away. The great Rubert has no time for you." It said,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I chuckled, "Rubert, is it? Do you think I could borrow a small portion of your time?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rubert looked at me with a skeptical tilt of his head. He stamped his front hoof and snorted, the sound echoing slightly. “You can understand me, peasant?” he said, his voice condescending. His ears flicked back and forth, whether from annoyance or bafflement, I couldn’t quite tell..</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I nodded and replied, "I can indeed, and I was wondering if I could ask for your help. A thief stole someone’s prized heirloom, and we need your help catching up to him."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rubert thought about it for a moment and muttered to himself, "A chase... hmm... that would be more exciting than this…"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I smiled with anticipation. “For every second we wait here the farther away the thief gets farther. A noble steed, such as yourself, wouldn’t want to miss out on the chance of becoming a hero… right?” I said, unsure, hoping that would convince him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The horse stamped his feet, "I say, that sounds quite exciting! I am all for assisting you!" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">A mixture of relief and joy washed over me as now Rose and I could continue the chase. Hopefully, the </span><span class="c3">thief</span><span class="c3"> </span><span class="c3">hadn't</span><span class="c3"> gotten too far ahead of them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">"Lad, why on earth are you talking to the horse?" A Dwarf with a long black beard, covered in straw and dirt, walked up to me. </span><span class="c3">The man</span><span class="c3"> wore overalls that had some cuts and stains. "What are you, </span><span class="c3">crazy</span><span class="c0">?" they asked with raised eyebrows.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I </span><span class="c0">gave out a nervous laugh, "Oh no no. You see, my magic allows me to communicate with animals."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">He jumped </span><span class="c3">back, his</span><span class="c0"> arms raised in front of him,  eyes wide. “Magic!?” He drew a knife, his voice trembling. “What do you want from me? Magic users bring nothing but trouble! Were you the one who set the tavern on fire?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“No!” I stammered, holding up my hands in a placating gesture. “I just wanted to ask if we could borrow one of your horses.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"We!? There are more of you!?" His grip tightened on his knife. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rose walked up behind me and chirped, "We are assisting knights in capturing a thief that has escaped the kingdom's walls." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Dwarf seemed to back down and think for a moment. "Hmm... that would give my stables quite the reputation. Very well! You may choose any horse." He paused, his gaze narrowing. "But be warned, Rubert is quite stubborn. He doesn't often like being ridden." With a gruff nod, he turned and walked away, muttering something under his breath about stubborn horses and careless riders. His boots echoed off the stone as he disappeared into the shadows of the stable.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Smiling, I turned to Rose and said, “Thank you so much!” </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her eyes lit up as a warm smile graced her lips. Before she could say anything, I scooped her into a hug. When I pulled back, I noticed a mix of surprise and blush on her cheeks. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">“Oh, I’m sorry!” My stone body quaked as I realized that I may have overstepped and became embarrassed. “Sorry… </span><span class="c3">I tend to be a bit of a hugger</span><span class="c0">…”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Rose giggled, covering her mouth as if to hide her amusement, and said, "You're fine. Shall we get going?" She looked up at the signs above the horses' stables to read their names. "Well, Rubert is probably not an option as he-" Before she could finish, I had already mounted Rubert's back, ready to go. </span><span class="c3">Rose seemed surprised</span><span class="c0"> at how quickly I had climbed onto the horse, despite the old man’s warning.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">"Want to come on?" I</span><span class="c3"> asked with a </span><span class="c0">nervous titter. Rose nodded and I held Rubert steady as she managed to climb on. "All right, Rubert! Let’s go!" I shouted, and Rubert nodded. From behind me, I could hear a small gasp from Rose as the horse nodded in response to my command.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As we neared the man, he rushed through the portal. "Rubert! Hurry!" I urged as the portal flickered, its edges curling in as if being pulled shut. Rubert’s hooves pounded the ground, muscles coiling and stretching as he raced toward the closing gap. His breath came in short bursts, nostrils flaring, just as he leaped through, the portal sealing behind him with a soft snap.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">On the other side, the air turned cool and earthy. Tall trees rose around us, their branches casting long shadows over the forest floor. Rubert slowed, his sides heaving, and ahead, the mouth of a dark cavern stretched open, quiet and waiting. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">I slid off Rubert’s back and reached my hand out to assist Rose.</span><span class="c2"> </span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Thank you very much" Rose said, tucking a loose strand of hair behind her ear with a quick motion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">When we both had dismounted, Rubert turned to me and declared, "I shall wait for the two of you here. None shall remove me."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I smiled and replied, "Thank you, Rubert."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Rubert tilted his head, his brow furrowing slightly. "But might I ask, where did your female friend go?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">I spun around, scanning the area. Rose had vanished. My heart thudded. "Rose...?" I called, my voice rising, a prickle of unease crawling up my spine. </span><span class="c5">"Where did you go</span><span class="c5">?"</span></p><hr/><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c2 c24"></span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c2 c24"></span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><h5 class="c7 c23" id="h.2et92p0"><span class="c21">CHAPTER </span><span class="c21">3</span><span class="c21"> </span><span class="c13 c8">                                                                                                   Subterranean Dwelling</span></h5><p class="c9 c19"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16 c8 c6 c14">Rose’s View</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c5 c8 c6 c14"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">As Deta chatted with Rubert, I glanced around at my surroundings in awe of the beauty around me. It had been a longtime since I’d left the castle and never without my sisters. My gaze rested on the cavern, </span><span class="c5">its</span><span class="c5"> gloomy darkness sending a chill through me, though we had yet to enter it. A soft breeze blew toward me and.. I could have sworn I heard something. Like a soft moan or cry, coming from the depth of a cave. My brow furrowed, unsure if the thing I had heard was human or just a figment of my mind. Inching closer to the cavern, I listened, straining to possibly hear it again. Only silence greeted me. </span><span class="c5">Relieved, I turned</span><span class="c5"> to return to Deta when, all of a sudden, I felt a hand </span><span class="c5">clamp</span><span class="c2"> over my mouth, yanking me into the shadows of the cavern. Panic surged through my core as I struggled, dragging my boots in the dirt, trying to get Deta’s attention, but whoever had grabbed me held tight. My strength waned as I was dragged deeper into the darkness, my thoughts reeling with fear and confusion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The further we went, the darker it became, like the shadows were swallowing me whole. The damp air pressed against my skin, chilling me as the cave seemed to close in. I fought back harder, but each movement felt like I was hitting a wall—my captor was too powerful. Tears of frustration trickled down my cheeks, my energy dwindled down to nothing once more, my body trembling from overexerting itself. A sharp pain shot through my neck and the world around me faded into nothing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">When I finally came to, I found myself restrained to a post, thick ropes biting into my wrists, the side of my neck throbbing from where it had been struck. My surroundings came into focus slowly—a campfire flickered nearby, casting long shadows. Three large men stood around, their faces illuminated by the flames. A gag had been shoved into my mouth, making it impossible to call out, and every attempt to move sent sharp pains through my bound hands. As I shifted, I felt something sharp behind me. Pain shot through my fingers, but I couldn’t let that stop me—I had to get free. My movements must’ve caught the attention of one of the men because his gaze flicked towards me. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">An old man in ragged clothes rose slowly from where he sat. "Well, well, well... looks like the lady's awake," he rasped, his voice like gravel. The other two men turned to me, grinning like they knew something I didn’t.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"She sure is, John," one of them added, coughing as he settled by the fire.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Fear knotted in my stomach as I tried to inch backward, but the pole kept me pinned. As I wriggled in my bonds, my hands once again brushed against something sharp. Hope flared inside me as I started sawing at the ropes, praying they’d give before the men noticed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The old man’s chuckle sent chills down my spine. "Oh, little girl, you’re not going anywhere. Best sit still, or we’ll have to punish you." He lifted his hands, and a faint blue glow enveloped them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Out of nowhere, three glowing blue projectiles shot from his hands and streaked toward me. Terror gripped me as I struggled to raise my arms to protect myself, screaming despite the gag.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Just as the magic was about to hit, the rope snapped. My hands now free, I </span><span class="c5">raised</span><span class="c5"> them to </span><span class="c5">shield</span><span class="c2"> myself. There were three loud bangs as the projectiles collided with some invisible force. Dust filled the air, and I heard the old man laugh—until it cleared.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">All three men stood in shock. A soft white glow shimmered around me. A magical shield had formed, and I peeked through my arms, barely believing what I saw. </span><span class="c5 c8 c6 c14">Was this me? Did I do this?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The old man’s face twisted in anger. "A magic user, eh? You’ll regret that." He motioned to the other two, and they rose, pulling out daggers as they stepped toward me.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16 c8 c6 c14">Deta’s View</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c5 c8 c6 c14"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">While I searched the bushes on the surface, Rose’s scream ripped through the air, echoing from the cave and snapping my focus.</span><span class="c3"> Without hesitation, </span><span class="c3">I rushed towards the cave entrance and saw three flashes of blue light accompanied by three loud bangs.</span><span class="c0"> "Rose!! I'm coming!" I yelled as I passed by Rubert and entered the dim cavern.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">As I sprinted t</span><span class="c3">hrough the cave, I noticed a large ditch blocking my path.Even in the dim light, my eyes caught the outline of a path to leap over it, and I pressed forward without breaking stride. As I got closer,a strange clicking sound came from somewhere just out of view. I turned my head, trying to determine the source of the sound, but then tripped over a rock </span><span class="c3">just as I came</span><span class="c0"> to the ditch. "Oh, shoot!!" I exclaimed, trying to regain my balance but failed and fell in.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">What I thought was a small ditch turned out, as luck would have it, to be a large hole.</span><span class="c3">.</span><span class="c0"> I tumbled for what felt like minutes before hitting a body of water.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I panicked, realizing that I hadn’t taken a good breath before plunging into the water. As someone made </span><span class="c3">partially</span><span class="c0"> of stone, I felt the weight of the water drag me further and further down. My limbs, heavy and unyielding, scraped along the bottom as I stumbled through the dark depths.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After a few tense moments, I managed to find a shallow spot where I could push off the sandy floor and wade towards a small land mass that loomed above the surface. I dragged myself onto the shore, the gritty sand grating against me and sticking to my wet clothes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Collapsing onto the ground, I let out a long sigh. “Oh gosh… that wasn’t fun” </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Catching my breath, I looked around. The walls were steep and slick, leaving no way to climb back up. I was stuck on a small patch of sand, surrounded by dark, rippling water.</span><span class="c3"> </span><span class="c3">A few</span><span class="c0"> skeletal remains were scattered about the sandy dune. Apparently, I was not the first victim this pit had claimed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A flicker of movement caught my eye—a narrow alleyway where water flowed in a steady stream. "Well, that's better than nothing," I muttered, making my way toward it. Stepping into the current, the water quickly rose around me, but with stone for skin, I didn’t swim so much as walk beneath the surface. My heavy body pressed against the pull of the water, slow but steady.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I kept one hand pressed against the wall. Each step felt deliberate, my fingers trailing along the rough stone to keep balance as the water tugged at me. Whenever the current grew stronger, I tightened my grip, around the stone begging i wouldn't get swept away.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">As I made my way through the underwater passage, I noticed an incline in the floor. </span><span class="c3 c6">Yes! The surface!</span><span class="c3"> I thought with relief, my tense shoulders easing just a fraction. Climbing up the incline, I emerged into a much larger room, </span><span class="c3">feeling a tingling sensation</span><span class="c0"> at having escaped the underwater passage. I exhaled slowly, my body began to absorb the water from my drenched clothes. The moisture seeped into my wooden frame, easing the cracks, while the stone held onto the lake’s lingering chill.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">"Oh, thank heavens... no more water..." I shook my head to get rid of the water in my eyes and looked around. </span><span class="c3">As my eyes adjusted to the dim light, I realized the room was larger than the last, though it wasn't much of an improvement. Bones, scattered in pieces, littered the ground, mixed with broken chunks of wood. The air felt still and heavy, the remnants of a struggle clear, but now all that remained was the quiet, echoing off the walls.</span><span class="c0">"Oh, how lovely..."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I surveyed the room and saw a passageway, </span><span class="c3">but it was on the other side of the pool </span><span class="c3">I had</span><span class="c3"> come out of.</span><span class="c0"> On the side I was on, there were two passages and a staircase leading up. "I'll stay on this side," I muttered to myself, turning toward the staircase. “Maybe these will lead somewhere. I have to find Rose.” </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The staircase carved straight into the rock of the underground cave. The steps were rough and uneven, blending into the natural stone walls. Each tread seemed to merge with the rock, creating a sense of an endless climb. The stone was marked with veins of minerals, catching the faint light as I ascended. The air grew cooler and damper with every step, the silence of the cavern pressing in around me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">"I...hate...stairs..."</span><span class="c0"> I huffed, the stairs seemed to go on forever, sapping my energy like a Scorp feeding on a Sklerp. But as I got higher up, I noticed a door. "Yes! This is exactly what I..." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The door creaked open into a small, dimly lit room. Moss clung to the walls, mingled with patches of what appeared to be dried blood. The air was thick with a metallic tang and damp red moss clung to the walls adding to the smell, like water left to fester in a forgotten corner.</span><span class="c3"> </span><span class="c0">Tables with scattered boxes stood in the corners, but my gaze drifted to the figure bound to the wall. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She had a light muscular build and was chained up off the ground, covered in cuts, bruises, and blood. The bones were sticking out of her arms and legs, jagged and wrong, skin stretched too tight around the breaks. Every shallow breath made her twitch, the motion tugging at torn flesh, sending fresh jolts of pain through her ruined limbs. Blood, sticky and half-dried, clung to her skin, pulling at open wounds with every shift. Her fingers trembled, curling in on themselves as if trying to hold onto something—anything—to ground herself against the agony.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Ma'am...?" I hesitantly approached her. "Can you hear me?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">There was no response. Her head hung forward, chin resting against her collarbone, strands of matted hair sticking to the sweat and blood caked across her face. Her eyes were shut, lids twitching slightly, as if trapped in some distant nightmare. Shallow, uneven breaths shuddered through her cracked lips, each one barely lifting her chest.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">“She must have passed out..” </span><span class="c3">My stomach churned as I realized the extent of the torture this poor woman had endured. I couldn't imagine the pain she must have been in. Whatever the reason may have been for this woman’s imprisonment, it could not </span><span class="c3">justify</span><span class="c0"> this level of suffering. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I recalled my training with Vomete, remembering a spell to heal wounds. Taking a deep breath, I focused my energy, concentrating on casting the spell. My arms glowed a deep green and </span><span class="c3">with trembling hands, I touched the woman's broken leg, watching as the bones retracted and reformed under my touch.</span><span class="c0"> I hesitated for a moment before placing my hand on her chest, feeling the shallow rise and fall of her breath. The glow from my hands intensified and, to my relief, the woman's breathing grew stronger.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her eyes snapped open, wild and unfocused, pupils blown wide with something between rage and desperation. With a sudden, violent jerk, she lunged at me, the chains biting into her skin as they yanked her back. A guttural, animalistic snarl tore from her throat. I stumbled away, my arms instinctively raising, the glow flickering out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Hey! I'm here to help you!" I said quickly, my voice tight with urgency. "I just need to heal your wounds!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She didn't seem to hear me. She thrashed and writhed, her body twisting against the restraints, muscles straining despite the jagged bones jutting from her limbs. Her breath came in ragged, shuddering gasps, her face contorted in raw, mindless fury. I took another step back—too fast. My foot caught the leg of a table, sending it crashing to the ground as I landed hard beside it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Heart pounding, I scanned the room, desperate for something—anything— that could either free her or at least stop her from tearing herself apart. That’s when I saw it: a small box on the floor, a bottle of red liquid nestled inside.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Sometime ago, there had been some travelers lost in the woods. They held bottles like these to their lips whenever one of them was injured. Perhaps they were healing drinks of some kind? I grabbed one and approached her again. She was still struggling when I opened the bottle and splashed it on her face</span><span class="c3">. I</span><span class="c0"> could see the fury in them begin to settle, her tense body allowing itself to droop just a little. Only when she relaxed did I dare to inch closer, another bottle uncorked and my hand cupped ready to assist her with taking it. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">By the time she drank all the bottles, her body had mostly recovered, save for a few </span><span class="c3">bruises</span><span class="c0">. "Thank you," she said, finally able to speak.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">"It's no problem," I replied, relieved that she was okay. "What's your name?" </span><span class="c3">Once we got her out of the chains</span><span class="c0">, We sat in heavy silence, the weight of unspoken words thick between us. Finally, she exhaled softly and spoke.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her name was Gwen. She didn’t remember much about her past, or so she claimed, but there were things she held back—hesitations that flickered across her face, small pauses where words seemed to catch in her throat. Whatever she did remember, some part of her wasn’t ready to share.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She was around five foot seven inches with dark skin and wild, matted hair full of rocks and sticks. Additionally, she had deep blue eyes. I was struck by her unique dark skin tone, one I had never encountered before in a human. But when I asked about it, her expression hardened immediately.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"What does it matter?" she snapped, her voice sharp and defensive.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I flinched at the sudden edge in her tone. She shot me a glare, her eyes narrowing with annoyance. Her posture stiffened, and she crossed her arms tightly, as if trying to protect herself from something more than just my questions. She approached the nearest box and threw off its lid, and being unsure what to do I copied.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">We rummaged through the boxes and, unsure</span><span class="c0"> of what we were looking for, I tried to speak to her “So… Gwen? What are we looking for exactly?” </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">She groaned. “My </span><span class="c3 c6">things</span><span class="c0">.. What else do you think, Tree Face?” </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">“Your things? Got it.” I gave out a nervous chuckle. “Um, I hate to ask this but, I lost my friend down here.. I think she was kidnapped-”  </span><span class="c3">But before I could finish, she found her belongings in one of the boxes and let out a sigh of relief when she uncovered her metallic shirt made of chains and a bag. </span><span class="c3 c6">Humans really are confusing creatures,</span><span class="c0"> I thought.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After putting some things into the bag and donning some slightly large pants and her shirt, she turned to me "Alright," she stood up and brushed her hair back. "As thanks for helping me escape those chains, I will help you in finding your friend. However, I have no intention of becoming a captive again," she glared at me, sending shivers down my spine. "Do you get that?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I bobbed my head., "Yes, I assure you that I have no such intentions. I just want to find my friend." I let out a nervous chuckle, </span><span class="c3">hoping to ease the tension between us</span><span class="c3">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She didn't look convinced. My eyes darted around the room, landing on a rusted sword jutting from a corpse. I gestured toward it. "Uh, maybe we should take that? Just in case—"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before I could finish, Gwen stepped forward, planted a foot on the body, and yanked the sword free with a sickening squelch. I swallowed hard, deciding not to push my luck.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We left the room and headed back the way I’d come. As we turned the corner to go down the last flight of stairs, I spotted a giant spider drinking from the lake below, its body about the size of a small deer. I turned to warn Gwen about disturbing it, but my foot slipped on the damp steps.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The next thing I knew, I was tumbling down the rest of the stairs.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This caught the spider's attention, and it ran in my direction. “Food! Die! Die!” I heard the spider yell in a scratchy, high-pitched, hissing voice that rang through my ears. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Before I could react, the spider was on me, sinking its fangs into my arm. </span><span class="c3">The</span><span class="c3"> pain spread like fiery cracks, chipping away at my stone and wooden arm and leaving a relentless, deep ache. While stuck on the ground underneath the spider's weight, I managed to grab a long piece of wood from off the ground and fight back against the creature, smacking its leg and causing it to screech out in pain. “</span><span class="c3">I'm not</span><span class="c0"> food! Get away from me!”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The spider’s weight pressed down onto me, making it difficult to move. I could hear the scuffle of Gwen’s approach, the ring of metal as she drew her sword, and her frustrated grunt as she missed her target.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The spider, now furious with me, tried to bite down again and shot some green liquid from its fangs, but it bounced off my stone flesh and burnt some of the wood of my arm. I cried out and hit its leg again, breaking it, causing the creature to screech and stumble. This gave Gwen the chance to attack the creature again. She slashed on the spider’s abdomen, but its </span><span class="c3">hide was so thick</span><span class="c3"> that the sword slid down its </span><span class="c3">sid</span><span class="c0">e.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The creature screeched out in pain as its deep blue </span><span class="c3">blood spewed out</span><span class="c0">. I threw the spider off and tried to get up, but it bit my arm again with so much force that when it pulled, it tore my forearm off. I took a few steps back as a sharp agony tore through me, making me drop the long stick.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">My fear flipped to fury as the pain </span><span class="c3">consumed</span><span class="c0"> me, the vines on my skin twisted and grew, forming a whip in my hand. Sharp thorns sprouted along its length, ready to strike, I lashed out at the creature, the barbed vines striking with a satisfying crack.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Gwen then took her sword and slashed at its large abdomen again, causing its organs to fall out and be exposed. It screeched and tried to escape, but I would not let it. Not an ounce of sympathy remained as  I used my thorn whip to grab it by its liver and pull it back to us. Gwen took the opening and speared the thing through its head, causing blood to splatter all over her, and the creature fell limp.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I took a deep breath, feeling the tension settle like cracks forming in my frame. My body was sturdy, but even stone could break under enough pressure. This was the first time I had truly been in danger—real danger—and if I continued down this path through the cave, it wouldn’t be the last.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I exhaled slowly, letting the weight of the moment pass like wind through the trees. Fear never helps as Vomete would say. I had to stay steady. I wasn’t just some lost wanderer stumbling through danger—I had a purpose.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shaking off the lingering dread, I straightened and let a small, familiar smile return. "Alright," I muttered to myself. "Let’s keep moving."</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c3"> </span><span class="c3">My fingers flexed, seeking something solid to hold onto. When I turned to Gwen to see if she was alright</span><span class="c3">, I saw that she’d turned white as snow and shaking. Before I could speak, her deep blue eyes rolled back into her skull, and she collapsed onto the ground unconscious.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After an hour, she finally stirred. I glanced over from where I crouched by the small, flickering fire, prodding the embers in a futile attempt to keep them alive. The dim orange glow cast restless shadows against the damp stone walls, the smoke curling upward in thin, lazy trails.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">A thin blanket, rough and smelling faintly of dust and old fabric, was draped over her shoulders. She sat with her back pressed against the wall, her breath slow but uneven. The fire cracked weakly, struggling against the cold air that seeped through the cracks in the stone. Tending fires wasn’t my strength, and the flames seemed to mock my efforts, shrinking every time I thought I had them under control.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I turned around when I heard her stir and was relieved to see that she was awake. "Gwen! I'm so glad to see you're okay." I smiled, but she seemed confused. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"What about your arm? How did it regenerate?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I was a little taken aback by her question, but then I remembered that most people considered my kind to be a mere fairy tale, as </span><span class="c3">the deep voiced child</span><span class="c0"> who worked with the demon knight had mentioned. "Oh, it's just one of my abilities. After a certain amount of time, I can piece my body back together with the materials around me."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She looked at me with a puzzled expression. She gave me a puzzled look, her eyes narrowing as she studied me. Then, her expression shifted —understanding dawning as she put the pieces together.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Without saying anything, she got up, wadded up her blanket and stuffed it back into her bag.. "</span><span class="c3">I see you went through my things</span><span class="c0">," she remarked, sounding a little annoyed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Sorry about that," I apologized sheepishly. "I didn't know what to do, so I was hoping you had some supplies or something." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She let out a deep sigh and shook her head. "Whatever. Let's just focus on finding your friend and getting out of here," </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We packed up our camp and made our way to a narrow set of stairs that turned a corner, leading into a larger chamber thick with cobwebs. Another stairway was visible on the other side. Memories of our last battle crept in, and I let out a sigh before glancing at Gwen, who looked a little shaky.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Are you alright?" I asked, catching the tension in her stance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She scoffed, her voice flat. "I'm fine. Let's just burn these webs and get moving."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">With </span><span class="c3">that</span><span class="c0">, she took a small stick out of her bag and flicked it against the wall, igniting it. She then dropped the stick onto the webs on the floor, causing them to burn slowly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">"Uh... okay?" </span><span class="c3">I was hesitant about burning the webs</span><span class="c0">, as that could disturb more giant spiders, but agreed to go along with it. Looking around the room, I noticed that the entrance on the other side was blocked by cobwebs that would eventually burn on their own. There didn't seem to be much else we could do, so I let out a sigh."Can I get one of those sticks?"  </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Gwen nodded and passed me a stick, and I struck it against a web-free surface, igniting it as she had. I placed the burning stick on a cobweb a</span><span class="c3">s the webs began to burn away,</span><span class="c3"> revealing two dead animal bodies. One of them was lying on its side, and when it was exposed, </span><span class="c3">Gwen flinched in surprise</span><span class="c0"> thinking they were more spiders.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After burning through enough webs, the doorway finally cleared. I couldn't help but chuckle, a smile creeping across my face. "Alright! We can continue onward!" I exclaimed. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Gwen nodded, her lips pressing into a thin line as she glanced away</span><span class="c0">, and we stepped into the next room, which was also covered in cobwebs much to our disappointment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">This time, Gwen stepped forward, taking the lead. I looked at her confused as she flashed a grin. "Last time you led, you lost an arm," she joked with a slight grin.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I smiled and said with a slight laugh. “That's not fair!”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Unfortunately, our banter had drawn unwanted attention. Two younger spiders emerged from the darkness, their eyes glinting menacingly. I quickly warned Gwen, and we both fell into battle stances. </span><span class="c5">The spider closest to Gwen lunged at her</span><span class="c3">, aiming for her face, but with practiced </span><span class="c3">movement</span><span class="c3">, she </span><span class="c3">seized</span><span class="c3"> its leg and hurled it aside.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">"Not these pests again!" </span><span class="c3">she yelled, her face scrunching in disgust, as she got ready to fight them again</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The spider closest to me leapt, trying to bite me, but I managed to block its attack with my arm once again. The pain was less intense than before, spreading slower but it still left a persistent, deep ache.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"I hate these things," I muttered to myself. Remembering my thorn whip, I summoned it, using it to lash out at the spider.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">I watched as Gwen charged at the webspinner, but her foot caught on a hidden web, causing her to stumble and miss her strike. Seeing an opening, the creature attacked, but Gwen jerked back, </span><span class="c5">narrowly</span><span class="c5"> avoiding </span><span class="c5">its</span><span class="c2"> fangs.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The other spider lunged at me again, its movements sharp and fluid, as if it were gliding over the ground. Each step was calculated, its legs skittering across the stone with unnerving precision. Remembering its previous attack, I sidestepped just in time, pulling my arm out of harm’s way. I retaliated by releasing a cloud of poison from my hand. The mist enveloped the spider, making it stagger and falter, its legs twitching erratically as it struggled against the poison’s effects.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">“Die, you filthy beast!” Gwen shouted and I watched as she drove her sword into the spider’s head. </span><span class="c5">The blade pierced through its immature hide</span><span class="c2">, causing the spider to go limp and stop struggling.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">My attention snapped back to my enemy as its fangs sank into my arm. Pain jolted through me, making me hesitate. I had no chance to strike back before the spider tore deeper into my forearm.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Gwen turned her attention to the spider that held me. She charged forward, and with her sword managed to smack the spider off of my arm.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Thank you for-” </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">“Shut it!” Gwen seized the opportunity and, with grim determination, drove her sword into the spider’s abdomen. Her blade hit vital organs, and the creature </span><span class="c5">convulseMy attention snapped back to my enemy as its fangs sank into my arm. Pain jolted through me, making me hesitate. I had no chance to strike back before the spider tore deeper into my forearm.d before stiffening</span><span class="c2">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She extended her sword toward me, her hand trembling slightly. "Could you clean the blood off?" she asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Confused, I hesitated. "Are you alright?" I asked softly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She nodded her head, offering a faint smile. "I’m fine… I just don’t want to pass out again."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Realization dawned on me, and I smiled as I sat down, pulling a rag from my bag to wipe the blade clean. "There, the blood’s gone." I held the sword out by the blade's tip, offering it back to her. She took the hilt with a grateful nod.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yawning, I glanced around. "It’s getting late... I think." We both chuckled, though weariness weighed on our voices. Gwen scanned the area, her gaze sharp, but no enemies remained in sight.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She sighed in relief. "Maybe, but we still need to find your friend."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Suddenly, soft music drifted through the air. Its quiet, melodic notes felt dreamlike, as if we were floating on a cloud. A strange warmth settled over me, my limbs growing heavy, my thoughts sluggish. My eyelids drooped, and I yawned again.  </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Where is that music coming from?" I asked, my voice thick with exhaustion.  </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen looked around, but her legs buckled beneath her, and she sank to the ground, stifling another yawn. "I don’t know," she murmured, her words slow and drowsy.  </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The next thing I knew, I was on the floor, my body refusing to move. Gwen lay asleep in front of me, her breathing deep and steady. A shadow loomed over her—a figure crouched at her side, tying her hands behind her back. He wore leather armor, his long white hair falling over his shoulders. Around his waist, a strip of white fur contrasted against his purple pants, and large leather boots planted him firmly on the ground. A small harp swung from his side, its strings still quivering.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"There we go," he muttered, tightening the bindings with practiced ease.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">As I woke up more and focused, </span><span class="c3">I could</span><span class="c3"> see he had pale gray skin and long pointed ears. </span><span class="c3">I sprang to my feet</span><span class="c0">, summoning vines and roots to trap him. He struggled, but one arm remained free. He drew a dagger and hurled it at me, grazing my side. I winced, grabbing at the chipped stone. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">"</span><span class="c3">I'm done</span><span class="c0"> with all this stupid fighting!” I growled, advancing. I tore out one of the long thin roots from the floor, which gave off a faint glow after straightening itself, and struck him across the head.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The commotion stirred Gwen from her enchanted sleep. She too had been bound by roots, but broke free of them with ease. Grabbing her sword from the ground, she slashed at the man, leaving a deep wound in his upper arm. His expression twisted in pain, realizing he had underestimated us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Please don’t kill me!" he pleaded, his voice shaking. Gwen narrowed her eyes, unconvinced.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I turned to the man. "Why were you trying to tie up my friend?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">recognizing him, Gwen stepped forward, fury building in her eyes. "Rinn," she spat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He laughed weakly, his bravado crumbling. "Gwen! I see those wounds healed quick!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She punched the side of his face then grabbed his throat pinning him in the air. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Rinn chuckled, speaking between faint gasps. “I take it… the creature behind you… used the potions? </span><span class="c3">I'm surprised</span><span class="c0"> you remember me” He let out another weak laugh.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Gwen tightened her grip. “</span><span class="c3">Those potions almost saved you</span><span class="c0">, but I can’t forget the man who made my life hell for seven years!” Her voice shook with anger, her fingers closing tighter around his throat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">“What do you mean?” I asked in confusion. </span><span class="c3 c8 c6">I had never heard of potions before. Was that the name of the colored water? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Gwen’s knuckles cracked as she squeezed harder. “Those potions you gave me? </span><span class="c3 c6">Restoration potions.</span><span class="c3"> They heal injuries, sure—but they </span><span class="c3 c6">also</span><span class="c3"> have this nasty little side effect of making people forget what’s been done to them.” Her tone dripped with venom. “Guess that worked out </span><span class="c3 c6">real</span><span class="c0"> well for you, huh?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rinn’s face began to pale. His hands clawed weakly at her arm, but she didn’t budge. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Gwen, let him go,” I said, my voice softer than I meant it to be.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She shot me a glare, her eyes wild with fury. “No! He deserves to die! He ruined my life!”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I stepped closer, my chest tight, my mind spinning. Was I stopping her for the right reasons? Or was I just scared? I met her furious gaze, searching for anything—hesitation, doubt, some sign that she didn’t really want to go through with it. For a moment, I thought she might just ignore me and finish it anyway. But after what felt like an eternity, her grip loosened, and she let him go, though her anger still smoldered in the air between us.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">The elf, Rinn, gasped for air, trembling. "Thank you, young creature. I—"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before he could finish, I punched him square in the face. A sharp crack rang out as my fist connected, flames briefly flickering across my knuckles. Rinn's head snapped to the side, and he staggered back, clutching his face. Blood dripped from his nose, pooling at his upper lip before he wiped it away with a shaky hand. He groaned, spitting a fleck of red onto the ground, his breathing uneven.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"If you ever harm Gwen again, I’ll make sure you regret it. Do I make myself clear?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rinn, stunned and dazed, nodded weakly, his fingers still pressed against his nose, as if unsure whether it was broken.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Now tie him up," I instructed Gwen. "We'll let others deal with him. For now, we need him alive."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Why should we?" she snapped, her eyes narrowing in immediate refusal.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I hesitated, choosing my words carefully. "He probably knows this place better than we do. If we keep him alive, we can use him as a guide. After that… we'll figure out what to do with him." My voice was steady, but tension lingered beneath it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With a curt nod, Gwen bound him, taking little care as to how deep the ropes cut into his wrists. She picked up Rinn’s harp and tossed it to me. "Catch, Bushy Hair.", </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I caught it, tucking it into my satchel. "We should also</span><span class="c3"> bandage his wound</span><span class="c0">. If he bleeds out he won't be of much help."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Oh.. how noble of you..” Rinn said with a roll of his eyes only to have Gwen punch him in the wound causing him to give a sharp recoil and fall silent. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">With Rinn securely tied, we moved onward. Our footsteps echoed in the stillness, and as we ventured further into the room, we found another exit to the left.</span><hr/></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><h5 class="c7 c23" id="h.tyjcwt"><span class="c21">CHAPTER 4</span><span class="c13 c8">                                                                                                                   Hungry Guests</span></h5><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Upon going through the west exit, we found a long sandy pass leading to a large underground lake. The beach stretched along the side of the cave, and a little path veered off to the middle of the lake. I sighed as we walked along the sandy passageway. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rinn gave a grin. "So, might I ask, what are you, fire hand boy? I've never seen a creature like you before."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen tugged at the rope, causing him to stumble a bit. "Stay quiet, monster," she said with scorn, then looked at me. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I hadn’t hardly heard them as I stared, transfixed, at my hand, which was still set ablaze. I questioned how I, being a Randeth—a being of nature—could somehow create fire. I then remembered something Vomete told me when I was a young boy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c6">We wer</span><span class="c3 c8 c6">e out in the garden, and the fire lily was struggling. Vomete extended her hand and set it aflame. The fire caused the lily to sprout up and appear much healthier, but I was stunned.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c8 c6">"Vomete? How can you use fire? Doesn't it hurt the forest?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c8 c6">Vomete smiled and patted my head. "Oh Deta, fire is more than destruction. It brings life and light to barren lands." She moved the fire closer for me to observe. "Fire is something only a few Randeths can use, and it only shows when passion and protection meet."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c8 c6">This left me puzzled. "What do you mean, Vomete?" I asked, still too young to grasp it. She chuckled softly. "When you're older and have more experience, you'll understand."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Gwen’s voice then shook me back to the present. </span><span class="c3">"Yo</span><span class="c0">u okay, Deta?" she asked. "You’ve been quiet for almost an hour."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I turned to her, my body tensing in slight surprise.. "Oh! Sorry! Just lost in my thoughts." I glanced back at my hand, and the fire had faded. I tried to summon it again but couldn't. "But yeah, I’m fine," I reassured her. I then looked at Rinn. "To answer </span><span class="c3">your earlier question</span><span class="c0">, I am a Randeth."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rinn scoffed. "A Randeth? Do you think I’m a child? Randeths don’t exist! They're just fables. If you were truly a Randeth, you could shift into a forest elk, which I doubt you can!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I sighed, rolling my eyes at Rinn's dismissive tone. "Believe what you want," I said, waving my hand before turning down a corridor and moving on.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As we continued, the path led us back into the cave system, eventually opening into a larger chamber. The sound of dripping water echoed off the walls, and the faint shimmer of an underground lake stretched out before us. A slim beach ran along one side, leading to another room deeper in the cavern. "Finally, some progress," I muttered, my voice carrying through the cavern. "Now we're one step closer to finding Rose!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rinn smirked, his eyes gleaming with mockery. “Rose? You collecting a polyg—”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before he could finish, Gwen’s fist slammed into his gut, cutting him off. “Shut up, or I’m throwing you in the lake,” she growled, her voice sharp with fury.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The room had three exits: one continued forward, another path led upwards, and a staircase descended. As we approached the center of the chamber, we heard a faint squeaking sound.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen let out an exasperated sigh. “If it’s not giant spiders, it’s rats! What’s next? A bear?” She threw her hands up in frustration, clearly fed up. “Honestly, I’d take anything other than these little pests.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I couldn’t help but chuckle at her comment, but Rinn scoffed once more.<br/> “It’s a cave, girl. You should be smart enough to know that by now,” he said, rolling his eyes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen shot him a wicked grin, her eyes narrowing. “Yeah, well, I’m starting to think you’re the biggest pest in here. At least the rats know when to shut up.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rinn smirked, trying to brush off her comment. “Nice try, but—”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before he could finish, Gwen’s eyes narrowed and her hand shot out, grabbing him by the collar. “Shut. Up.” Her tone was lethal, and she pulled him closer, letting the threat linger.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rinn’s bravado faltered for a second, but he quickly recovered, his jaw tightening. He met her gaze, unwilling to back down.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Well, which way should we go?” Gwen asked, dropping her grip on him but still glaring like she could tear him apart if he said one more word.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before I could answer, a heavy clunking sound shattered the silence, each step reverberating through the ground like distant thunder. It wasn’t just footsteps—it was something massive forcing its way forward, uncaring of what lay in its path. The air grew thick, charged with an unnatural weight as the shadows ahead twisted and split apart.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0">Then it emerged.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A towering humanoid figure, clad in ancient, rusted metal. Its armor was jagged, uneven, as if pieced together from the remains of something long forgotten. Chains dangled from its limbs, swaying with a metallic rattle, and the deep grooves in its helmet suggested something inside had been struggling—maybe for a long time. It moved strangely, its steps uneven, its entire frame shifting in ways that felt...wrong.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I didn't wait to see what it wanted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My arm extended, the stone and wood of my body shifting and groaning as the vines embedded in my form sprang to life. They twisted together, growing, stretching, until they formed a long, whip-like weapon. Sharp thorns jutted from its surface, glistening like fangs in the dim light. The weapon pulsed, brimming with raw energy, aching for release.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I wasn’t about to hesitate.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With a sharp crack, I lashed the whip forward, the air shrieking as the thorns sliced through it, striking the armored figure’s arm.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Who are you?” I said, my voice quieter than I meant, but steady. The whip coiled around its limb, thorns biting deep into the metal. I yanked hard, and with a sickening screech, a chunk of rusted plating tore free, clattering to the ground.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What spilled out wasn’t blood.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rats. A writhing, churning mass of them poured from the gap in the armor, their slick bodies squirming over one another, their beady eyes glinting in the dim light. They seethed and twitched, some vanishing back inside the hollow suit while others scrambled over the ground. The thing lurched but did not fall, the armor adjusting, shifting as the creatures within worked in grotesque harmony to keep it moving.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My breath hitched. This wasn’t a person. It wasn’t even a creature. It was a swarm. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Gwen charged at the humanoid, Rinn trailing behind her. With a sharp swing, she unsheathed her sword and sliced clean through its neck. The severed head hit the ground with a sickening </span><span class="c3 c6">thud</span><span class="c0">, and from the gaping hole in the helmet, a torrent of rats spilled out, writhing and screeching as they poured onto the floor like a living flood.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Rats!" Gwen recoiled, her voice thick with disgust.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before she could react further, the displaced rodents turned on her, their eyes gleaming as they leaped, teeth snapping. She sidestepped them with a scowl, but the grotesque puppet of armor lurched forward, swinging its massive mace in a deadly arc. Gwen barely dodged, the weapon smashing into the stone floor with a thunderous impact that sent dust and debris flying.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the chaos, Rinn seized his chance. He turned on his heel and bolted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen caught the movement instantly. With a sharp yank, she pulled on the rope binding him, jerking him backward. He crashed onto the ground with an undignified grunt, arms flailing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Meanwhile, I grabbed my staff, bracing myself as the fallen rats turned their attention toward me. They leaped, their gnashing teeth flashing in the dim light. I swung hard, smashing them mid-air, but more swarmed at my feet, clawing at my legs, trying to burrow into the crevices of my wooden skin. Gwen slashed at the writhing tide that scurried at her feet, her frustration mounting.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Deta! Use your fire and get rid of this abomination!" she shouted, voice tight with urgency.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I tried. I rushed forward, hand outstretched, but when I willed the fire to come, nothing but a pathetic spark flickered and died. Frustrated, I swung my arm wildly, hoping something—anything—would ignite, but before I could react, the rat-formed knight struck.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Its mace connected with my side in a brutal arc, and I barely had time to register the hit before I was airborne. Pain exploded through my body as I crashed hard onto the stone floor, the breath knocked from my lungs.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Dang it…" I wheezed, wincing. "That thing’s stronger than it looks."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen wasn’t about to let up. Her sword flashed, severing its remaining arm in one clean motion. But as the limb hit the ground, it didn't remain a lifeless hunk of metal. It dissolved—melted—into a wave of rats, scattering and reforming, surging toward her like a sentient plague.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nearby, Rinn was thrashing, his curses growing more panicked as the rats swarmed over him, biting and clawing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">"Dang it! Get off me, you filthy little—gah!" He kicked wildly, trying to shake them off, but they clung to his sleeves, gnawing through fabric and flesh. "This is why I hate dungeons and caves! Rats, traps, and—ow!—you useless vermin!" He flailed harder, but the more he struggled, the more they latched onto him. "I swear, when I get free, I'm burning this whole place down—</span><span class="c3 c6">with</span><span class="c0"> you two in it!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"As if!" Gwen shot back, slashing through another wave. "You should just die already, so shut up!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The rat-puppet swung again, its mace crashing down. I barely rolled aside, feeling the wind of its strike as it missed my skull by inches. Scrambling upright, I gripped my staff and slammed it against its side with every ounce of force I had. The impact sent a shudder through the armor, and suddenly, the creature collapsed—crumbling apart as the rats lost cohesion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">"I </span><span class="c3 c6">hate</span><span class="c0"> this thing!" I snarled, kicking at the vermin gnawing at my boots.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">"Yeah? You think I </span><span class="c3 c6">like</span><span class="c0"> them?" Gwen snapped, carving through the swarm with growing frustration.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Across the battlefield, Rinn was losing his fight, his movements growing more frantic as he was nearly buried in squirming bodies. Gwen spotted another surge of rats racing toward us and didn’t hesitate. She darted forward, slicing through them in two broad sweeps, then stormed toward Rinn. She grabbed the collar of his shirt and yanked him free, hurling him away from the worst of the swarm.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I swung the last few rats against the wall, their bodies smacking against the stone with wet, sickening </span><span class="c3 c6">thuds</span><span class="c0">. Those still alive scurried away into the darkness.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just as I caught my breath, I saw it happen—Rinn, scrambling to his feet, shot Gwen a wicked grin before kicking her legs out from under her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She hit the ground hard—right into the pile of seething rats.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Rinn snickered and turned to run, but Gwen still had the rope. She yanked it, sending him sprawling once more. "</span><span class="c3 c6">I'm going to kill you for that</span><span class="c0">," she growled, her voice dripping with murderous intent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I rushed forward, swiping at the rats clinging to her. "I'll try not to hit you, Gwen!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">"Forget that! Just </span><span class="c3 c6">kill them</span><span class="c0">!" she barked, slashing wildly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With two final, decisive swings, she carved through the remaining swarm. The few survivors scurried into the shadows, retreating into whatever horrors had spawned them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Breathing heavily, she glared daggers at Rinn, but instead of gutting him where he stood, she dug into her bag and tossed me a small glass vial.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Drink this," she muttered, her voice edged with exasperation. "It won’t fix your legs, but it’ll help."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I caught it, still trying to process the sheer </span><span class="c3 c6">awfulness</span><span class="c0"> of what we had just fought. I gulped down the bitter liquid, wincing as it burned its way down my throat. A moment later, the sting of my scratches faded, the splinters in my legs sealing up as if they had never been there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“That’s incredible! Thanks, Gwen!” I flexed my legs, relieved.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She smirked, wiping her sword clean on a rag. “No big deal. Now, which way?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Two paths stretched ahead. After a quick scan, I pointed toward the farthest tunnel. Gwen took the lead, stepping over rat carcasses while I kept an eye on Rinn, making sure he didn’t try to pull anything. As we walked, barrels lined the walls—whiskey, ale, and who knew what else.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The passage opened into a small room. In the far corner, a huddle of rats twitched, their beady eyes gleaming in the dim light.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“I want to try the fire again,” I told Gwen, tightening my grip on my staff.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She gave a quick nod. “Go ahead, but be quick.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Focusing hard, I forced a flicker of warmth into my fingertips. A small flame flared to life in my palm. I hurled it at the rats, and they scattered in panic, some catching fire and squealing as they darted away.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“I did it!” I grinned.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen rolled her eyes but kept her stance firm. “Nice work, but we’ve still got a few more to deal with!”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A fresh wave of rats surged toward her. She swung twice, each arc of her blade slicing through the swarm with brutal efficiency. But one of the vermin leaped up, sinking its teeth into her hair.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“I’ve got this!” I called, already raising my staff.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Wait—”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Too late. I swung, knocking the rat away—along with a solid hit to Gwen’s head.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rinn burst out laughing. “Oh, that was beautiful.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We were too exhausted to argue, but Gwen, scowling, turned and slugged him in the arm—right where he was already injured. He yelped, stumbling back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“What was that for?!” he whined, cradling his arm.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Because I don’t like you.” Gwen didn’t even look at him as she muttered it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I scanned the room, rubbing my sore shoulder from the recoil of my staff swing. In the far corner, three barrels stood side by side. Curious, I pried one open and found it stuffed with potatoes. The next held rice, and the last, beans.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Well,” I sighed, stepping back. “At least we have food now.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen dragged Rinn over without a word and plopped down. “Let’s eat a little and rest.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I nodded, sinking onto the floor beside them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As we approached, my eyes caught on an odd tile among the others—a little too smooth, a little too out of place. Suspicious. I turned to Rinn.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Rinn, step on this.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">He shot me a glare. “Do I </span><span class="c3 c6">look</span><span class="c0"> stupid? That’s a trap.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Without missing a beat, Gwen punched him hard in the face. He stumbled back with a curse, but she didn’t give him a chance to recover. Snatching his golden knife from its sheath, she pressed the cold metal to his throat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“You talk too much,” she muttered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rinn went rigid, his lips curling in fury, but he stayed silent. Gwen, unimpressed, flicked the knife toward me. “Use this.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The blade hit the ground with a metallic </span><span class="c3 c6">clatter,</span><span class="c0"> bouncing a few times before settling. I crouched, hesitated, then carefully placed it on the odd tile. The stone sank slightly—but nothing happened.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I exhaled, ready to move on. But something about it nagged at me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Grimacing, I started stacking dead rats onto the tile, one after another. Their bodies, still warm, left streaks of blood against the stone. The scent of singed fur and </span><span class="c3">rot </span><span class="c0">curled in the air, but I kept at it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Then—</span><span class="c3 c8 c6">click.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The tile lowered, and with a low grind of stone against stone, a hidden door creaked open.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen and I locked eyes, tension thick between us. I leaned forward, peering into the opening. Beyond, a dark hallway stretched into the unknown, a faint glow flickering at the far end. No sign of movement.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Without hesitation, I gestured for Gwen to follow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">We stepped inside, the air thick and stale, dust shifting with every footstep. Then—suddenly—the floor beneath me </span><span class="c3 c8 c6">gave way.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">A startled gasp tore from my throat as I plummeted. My stomach lurched—then </span><span class="c3 c6">thud!</span><span class="c3"> I hit something soft and </span><span class="c3 c6">wrong.</span><span class="c0"> A sickening squelch spread beneath me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My vision blurred. And then I felt it move.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">When my vision came to, there was a dull ache in my skull accompanied </span><span class="c3">by dizziness</span><span class="c0">. Blinking rapidly, I saw Gwen rushing toward the edge of the hole, pulling Rinn along with a rough yank.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"You okay?" she asked, her tone sounding tense with concern, but there was no real care behind it. I nodded, though my mind was still hazy from the fall.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My breath caught in my throat as something caught my eye—a monstrous centipede, the size of a small house, its body covered in slick, glistening segments. But it wasn’t just a centipede. Tentacles sprouted from its grotesque head, swaying like serpents, while its thousands of legs twitched, skittering across the ground with unnerving speed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The creature was still yet alert. It must have been disturbed by the collapse when I fell through the floor. It sniffed the air, testing the scents around it, before its many eyes fixed on me, narrowing slightly. Then, without any warning, it scurried up the wall, its legs scraping against the stone, and crawled along the ceiling as if gravity didn’t apply to it at all.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We stood frozen, all eyes locked on it, not daring to move. The only sound in the room was the creature’s legs scraping, the faint rustle of the air as it shifted its enormous body.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I wondered, irrationally, why it hadn’t attacked me. I glanced down—and then it became clear. I was surrounded by the lifeless bodies of adventurers, their faces frozen in horror, their limbs twisted at unnatural angles. Mixed with the debris, I blended into the mess. The creature had mistaken me for just another fallen scrap, as motionless as the broken wood and stone littering the floor.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I heard Gwen stir above me, her eyes darting between me and the centipede. She was already thinking. She always was.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Without a word, she turned to Rinn, who stood sullenly behind her. "You're coming with me."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rinn grumbled under his breath, but there was no fight in him. He knew better than to refuse. He followed her begrudgingly, the tension in his posture a stark contrast to her steely calm.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen moved swiftly across the room, her boots making barely a sound against the cold stone. She reached the entrance of the adjacent room and glanced back, her eyes meeting mine for a split second. She grabbed a handful of loose rocks from the floor then hurled them into the pit below me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The rocks tumbled and crashed, startling the creature. It paused, its antennae twitching as it turned its head down toward the sound. Satisfied that the distraction had worked, Gwen grabbed another rock, and with a practiced flick of her wrist, sent it sailing directly into the creature’s head.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">It howled—no, </span><span class="c3 c6">shrieked</span><span class="c0">—a low, guttural noise that rattled the walls. Pain and fury filled its strange, alien eyes. The centipede reared up and, with an angry hiss, slithered back down the wall, claws clattering against stone, heading straight toward the source of the provocation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Without wasting another second, Gwen yanked Rinn along as they sprinted back towards the room they had just left, the furious creature hot on their heels</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"> "I want no part of this! Unhand me!" Rinn protested, pulling against Gwen’s grip. But as Rinn glanced back, he realized there was no choice but to keep running. "Never mind! Hurry, run!" Rinn exclaimed, his eyes widening in terror.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen rolled her eyes and leaped into the pile of corpses, dragging Rinn down with her. "Deta! Move!" she shouted, scrambling free.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I stumbled to my feet, heart pounding, and spotted a passageway on the west side of the room. We rushed down the path, breathless, only to find ourselves in a dead-end chamber.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before we could react, the insect-like creature crawled down the wall toward us. Trapped, we had no choice but to retreat into the small room.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Once inside, we spotted three chests and each of us ducked behind one, hoping to remain unseen. But our hiding spot was only a brief respite, as the monster began to approach, drawn </span><span class="c3">by the scent </span><span class="c0">of death the corpses had left on us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rinn hissed, "This is madness! We're going to be found!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen snapped back, "Then be quiet and let’s figure something out!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The creature sniffed around, inching closer to our hiding spot. I urged the others, "Check your chest! Find whatever you can and get ready to fight!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I found a bottle of gray liquid—no clue what it was, but I hoped it would be useful. The others turned up nothing but worthless trinkets, like golden circles.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Desperate, Rinn demanded, "Give me my harp!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Absolutely not! You're not escaping!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Either give me my harp, or we're dead!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Seeing no other option, I groaned and shoved the instrument against his bound hands, hoping he could make use of it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just as the creature screeched its way into the room, I downed the drink. Energy surged through my veins, igniting every nerve.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gripping my staff with renewed strength, I charged forward, shouting, "Let's go!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Only one thought lingered in the back of my mind—what on earth had I just consumed?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As I rushed the monstrous creature, I swung my staff with all my might, shattering part of its exoskeleton. Gwen followed with swift precision, shooting something she found in her chest piercing its left eye.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The monster let out a blood-curdling scream, rearing back to strike—but before it could, Rinn stepped in front of us. With his wrists still bound, he awkwardly positioned his hands and dragged his fingers across the harp strings.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">A wave of powerful sound erupted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The creature was hurled backward, and I struggled to keep my balance as a deafening ring assaulted my ears. Yet Gwen, unfazed, loaded another shot and fired. The monster screeched in agony before collapsing, lifeless.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Rinn flashed a victorious grin, his hands now free, then turned with a chuckle. "See you later, fools."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">With a flick of his wrist, he played another melody, and a thick cloud of black smoke billowed from the ground, plunging us into darkness. </span><span class="c5">As Gwen cursed and rushed after him, I stumbled over the fallen creature</span><span class="c2">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Emerging from the smoke, I saw Gwen storming back and forth, kicking debris out of her way. She screamed furiously in a language I didn’t understand, her voice rising with every roll of her tongue.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">“</span><span class="c5">S</span><span class="c5">karveznar fururcrakarzhur yarerahrahsar! Ir sarwarerahrah taror ervezrahyar brulorererdruzhur kharahrah, rahirnarnar, ir’khal furlorahyar yarorur sarlororwar ahvrak morahkarer yarorur warahtarcrahar!”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Suddenly, she whirled around and slammed one of the bodies against the wall with a sharp crack. Even without knowing the words, I knew they were anything but pleasant.  </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">She slammed her sword into the ground with a bone-rattling crash, her breath coming in sharp, furious gasps. Folding her arms, she glared at the spot where Rinn had been. "That idiot—</span><span class="c5 c6">I'll tear him apart</span><span class="c2">. Just watch."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Then she glanced at me, </span><span class="c5">sprawled on the ground</span><span class="c2">. "Are you going to get up or take a nap?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">I chuckled. "Getting up." I stood, brushing the dust from my clothes. "</span><span class="c5">I just didn't want to interrupt your…venting.</span><span class="c2">"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">She rolled her eyes. "Whatever. I just want out of this stupid cave."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I nodded in agreement, then looked up at the hole in the ceiling where the hallway continued. We made our way back toward the room and the passage beyond.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Gwen huffed, still seething. "What are we doing back here?" she snapped, her frustration barely contained.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Well, the hall continues. Might as well see where it leads!" I shot her a quick look, trying to ignore the tension. "I think I can make it."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Gwen shook her head as I took a running start and leapt across, barely clearing the hole.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"See?" I said with a smirk. "Made it!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">I backed up, offering my hand to help her across, but she simply walked to the edge and hopped over with ease. </span><span class="c5">She strode past me with a sly grin, flicking her hair.</span><span class="c2"> I rolled my eyes and laughed as we continued down the hall. Gwen took the lead. When we reached the end, the hall opened onto the underground beach. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">A dying campfire smoldered nearby, its smoke curling in the damp air. Three bodies lay motionless, their forms marked by violent, scorched wounds. The smell of burnt flesh mixed with the salt of the sea, heavy and acrid. One body was nearly unrecognizable, its skin blackened and burned in patches, likely from the blasts of fire. The others were marked with deep, charred holes—small, precise burns, leaving raw, singed flesh around each wound. Their faces were frozen in agony, as though death had come swiftly, but painfully.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Gwen noticed a crate by the water's edge and moved to inspect it, but my attention was fixed on the bodies.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">My heart stopped when I saw it—the dark-colored shoe with the small white frill, clutched in one of the lifeless hands. </span><span class="c5 c8 c6 c14">Rose's shoe.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">She had been here, but now she was gone. My knees buckled as a wave of grief and guilt crashed over me. "Are we too late...? She's... dead..."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Tears blurred my vision as I collapsed to the ground. "I promised to protect her, and now she's gone!" My fist slammed into the earth, my voice a raw shout, "No!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Gwen stopped beside me, her gaze flicking to the shoe and the fragments of Rose’s dress scattered nearby. She took in the scene with growing realization, her eyes narrowing. "Hey... she might have escaped," she said, her voice softer now, though doubt still lingered in her tone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">I wiped away my tears</span><span class="c2">. "What do you mean...?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Gwen smiled. "Her body's not here. There's a chance she got out." She gave me a light punch on the shoulder. "Don't lose hope. You'll find her."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I forced a smile at Gwen's optimism, but it felt fragile, like it might shatter at any second. I slowly stood up, my knees trembling as the weight of everything hit me again. My breath was shaky as I exhaled, trying to push the grief aside. "Yeah... you're right," I muttered, but the words felt hollow. I let out a bitter laugh, then returned her gentle punch, the gesture more automatic than anything else. "Let's keep going."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Gwen led the way toward the faint glow, and I followed, the light growing stronger as we neared. It reflected off the uneven cave walls, casting long shadows around us, guiding us deeper into the cavern. As we rounded a bend, I recognized the place—it was the same cave where Rose and I had been before she was taken.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Watch out!’ I put my arm out stopping Gwen before she fell into the hole I did upon entering.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c2">        “I saw it..” She rolled her eyes and jumped over it</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Rubert stood waiting, exactly where he said he would be.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Ah, Sir! You’ve returned!" he called out, spotting us. "And it seems you’ve gained a new female companion."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I smiled. "Yes, I’m back, but we didn’t find Rose."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Rubert gave a low bow. "I am truly sorry. But I did see a human female who resembled her run out of this cave not too long ago. She only had rags left on her, poor thing."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">My eyes widened. "You saw her!?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Rubert stepped back slightly. "W-well, yes. Should I have stopped her?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I looked up at the sky with relief. "No, no... it’s fine."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I lowered my gaze back to him. "Everything's alright now, friend!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I turned to Gwen to share the news, but her expression was one of disbelief, as though watching someone talk to a horse they couldn’t hear. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"You sure are strange, Bushy."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I chuckled, feeling a bit self-conscious.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">We rode back to the city on Rubert, the wind slicing against our skin and whipping through our hair, carrying the scent of damp earth and distant chimneys. The rhythmic pounding of his hooves echoed through the quiet stretches of road, each jolt jarring our weary bodies as we tried to process everything that had happened. As we neared the city, the distant hum of life swelled into a chaotic symphony—street vendors shouting their wares, the clatter of cart wheels on uneven stone, the occasional bray of a restless mule.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The moment we passed through the gates, an old man hurried toward us, his tattered cloak fluttering with his hurried steps. His eyes, wide and glistening with anticipation, darted over our faces as though searching for an answer before we could even speak. The sharp scent of ink and parchment clung to him, mixing with the faint tang of sweat, and his gnarled fingers twitched at his sides as though barely restraining the urgency that propelled him forward.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Sir! Were you able to recover my family’s heirloom?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">My heart sank for a moment, anxiety pushing down on me, remembering how that had slipped my mind in the heat of everything. "I’m sorry, sir... all I found was this," I said, handing him Rinn’s golden knife. "I wasn’t sure if—"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Before I could finish, the old man’s face lit up with excitement. "Oh my great Entian! You’ve found it! This is it! Thank you, thank you!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">I breathed a sigh of relief, glad to know it was still something of importance. "I’m just happy we could help," I said with a chuckle, feeling </span><span class="c5">the weight lift off my shoulder</span><span class="c2">s.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Just then, a kind-faced woman, likely his wife, approached us from a nearby stall. "Dear, is everything alright?" she asked, </span><span class="c5">eyeing the golden knife</span><span class="c2">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The old man beamed and nodded enthusiastically. "Everything’s perfect! These fine folks recovered our family’s treasure."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">The woman smiled at us, then turned to Gwen, noticing her weary state. "You look exhausted, dear. Why don’t you come with me? Our shop is just </span><span class="c5">over there</span><span class="c2">, and I can help you freshen up. We’ve got some food too—something warm to ease your travels."  the old lady pointed off somewhere into town.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Gwen shrugged, letting out a sigh. “Why not?” she said, her voice low and tired. Without waiting for another word, she followed the woman, the old man trailing behind them with a quiet smile, guiding her towards the direction they had pointed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Suddenly, a voice interrupted my thoughts</span><span class="c2"> “He returned alive!” . It was Beans, alongside the Demon Knight. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Impressive," she said, her eyes gleaming with admiration. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">After an awkward chuckle in exchange they asked for me to explain what happened, so I did.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Beans chimed in, “</span><span class="c5">I'm surprised you made it back alive!”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">His comment stung</span><span class="c5">, but I smiled. "When the old man told us that </span><span class="c5">the Bard we locked up earlier</span><span class="c2"> had escaped—Rinn, no less!—and how he stole the family's magic dagger, we were going to send out a search party!" Beans exclaimed, his excitement palpable.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Confused, I asked, "What do you mean?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans explained that Rinn had a reputation for killing those who stood in his way and that no one had really seen what he looked like since he would use magic to disguise himself. "Naturally, we didn’t want someone the king had an eye on to die," he added.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">One of the knights scoffed. "That’s an understatement," he muttered. "The last person to cross Rinn was found in pieces—burned from the inside out like his own blood had turned to fire." Another knight shuddered. "I've heard he doesn’t even need a blade. Just a touch, and a man’s bones twist in on themselves like wet parchment."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“So, what happened to the princess's maid? Why is she not with you?” Beans asked, his voice hinting with worry.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Swallowing hard, I forced the words out. “She was taken,” I said, my voice tight. “By Rinn.” The weight of their stares pressed against me, suspicion creeping into their expressions. I could still see the moment she was dragged away, the terror in her wide eyes, the way her hands clawed at empty air as she vanished into the dark.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“She escaped somehow,” I added,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Bluma walked up, placing a hand on my shoulder. "Comrade," she said, tapping her chest. She pointed to a nearby inn, and we headed inside.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The inn was quaint and warm, the wooden floors creaking beneath our feet as the soft lighting cast a welcoming glow. Bluma arranged a room for me with a large bed and a tray of potions. Beans mentioned that he and Bluma wanted to talk later, but for now, I should rest.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">I spent a few hours cleaning up, reflecting on everything that had transpired. My thoughts kept drifting back to Rose, a pang of guilt lingering. But at least she had survived, and that gave me some comfort. Wherever she was, I hoped she was safe.</span><hr/></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><h5 class="c7 c23" id="h.3dy6vkm"><span class="c21">CHAPTER 5 </span><span class="c13 c8">                                                                                                                    Service Never Goes Unnoticed</span></h5><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16 c8 c6 c14">Gwen’s View</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c5 c8 c6 c14"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I followed the old man and his wife through the lively streets, their easy pace a contrast to the bustle around us. The old man hummed a tune under his breath, while his wife smiled quietly beside him. The warmth of the cobblestones beneath my tattered boots felt oddly comforting. The smells of fresh bread and spices drifted through the air, mingling with the noise of the crowd—shouts, laughter, the clink of metal from the blacksmiths. I glanced around at the marketplace, the bright stalls and colorful fabrics catching my eye, but it all felt a bit distant.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“So... what kingdom is this?” I asked, still taking in the sights with little more than passing interest.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The old man turned to me, smiling warmly. “This is the Kingdom of Sumring! It's been standing since before the Frost Era. We’ve survived countless attacks, thanks to the Crowned Royal.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I raised an eyebrow. “Crowned Royal? What’s that?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He gave a quick chuckle, his eyes twinkling. “Ah, it's just a term we use to refer to the royal family line. The ones who’ve ruled us for generations—protecting the kingdom through thick and thin.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I nodded, barely listening, already bored by the long-winded explanation. “Right... sounds like they’ve done their job. But where exactly are you taking me?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Oh, we’re heading to our shop,” the old man chuckled. “I’m the town’s blacksmith, and my wife here is the finest caretaker in the kingdom. We’ve served Sumring for years, crafting blades and tending to its people.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The old man chuckled softly, then gestured to his wife with a proud smile. “This here is Nana, my better half.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nana, his wife, giggled and added, “I’m more of a healer and seamstress these days, but I still do what I can.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her laughter was warm, though it barely registered over the noise of the street. I gave a small smile at the way they seemed so at ease with each other.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As we walked, I thought about my worn-out sword and smirked. “I could use a new blade.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The old man beamed with pride. “You’ve come to the right place! I’ve made weapons for the King’s knights. Some of my finest work. I’m sure I can find something just for you.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When we reached the shop, the old man pushed open the door, and I stepped inside, immediately hit by the smell of iron and smoke. The air was thick with the warmth from the forge, and I could feel the heat radiating off the glowing coals. Swords, axes, and shields lined the walls, their polished surfaces gleaming in the flickering light. The hum of the forge’s steady rhythm, the rhythmic clang of metal on metal from the back, added a certain pulse to the atmosphere. The wood beneath my boots creaked slightly, the scent of burning wood mixing with the sharp tang of metal. It was a place of steady work and unspoken history.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Impressive,” I muttered, my fingers tracing the hilt of a beautifully made sword.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Thank you!” The old man’s face lit up. “Take a look around. I’ll be in the back getting my tools ready to fix your armor.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nana, who had been quietly watching me, stepped closer. She frowned at the dirt and grime covering me. “My dear, you look like you’ve been through a battle. Why don’t I help you get cleaned up while my husband works?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I </span><span class="c3">hesitated for a moment</span><span class="c3">, the memory of past… </span><span class="c3 c6">discomfort </span><span class="c0">rolling in but the thought of a bath was too tempting to resist. “Alright.” I said pushing the unease aside.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Nana led me to a small, cozy room at the back of the shop. She filled a tub with warm water and handed me a fresh set of </span><span class="c3">towels</span><span class="c0">. “You’ll feel much better after this. I’ll take care of your old clothes and get something new ready.” She then left the room.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I sank into the bath</span><span class="c0">, letting the warmth ease the soreness in my muscles. I let the water eat away the layers of dirt and blood with some scrubbing, feeling lighter as the grime washed away. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After a while, Nana knocked gently on the door. “May I come in, dear?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“One moment,” I called, stepping out of the bath and wrapping myself in a towel. I cracked the door open. “Yes?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nana smiled, handing me a set of new clothes. “I made these for you while you bathed. Your old ones were beyond repair.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Surprised by the gesture, I took the clothes. “Thank you... you really didn’t have to.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">“It was no trouble,” Nana said with</span><span class="c36"> </span><span class="c5">a dismissive wave of her hand</span><span class="c0">. “I wanted to make sure you were comfortable.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I dressed in the new outfit: a brown-gray cloth undershirt that hung to my mid-thighs, a sturdy chainmail shirt, and a steel corset fastened with leather straps with a red cloth tied around my waist. The fitted leather pants felt like a second skin, included with them were brown leather boots with a small heel, and hand braces that were well-crafted and durable. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Admiring the fit, I couldn’t shake the feeling that these clothes had been made just for me. The way they fit, the little details that seemed too perfect—it didn’t sit right. Maybe it was the kind of thing people do when they’re trying a little too hard to be accommodating. I wasn’t sure, but something about it felt off.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When I emerged, Nana beamed. “Oh, it fits you perfectly! Not too tight, I hope?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“No, it’s great,” I chuckled. “Much better than what I had before.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“I’m glad you like it. My husband’s in the workshop, probably done with your armor by now.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I made my way downstairs, I made my way downstairs, the floorboards creaking underfoot, but it was the silence that really got to me. The closer I got to the heavy door of the workshop, the more something felt off. My skin prickled, the air felt thicker, like something was being hidden. Maybe I was overthinking it, but something didn’t add up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Opening the door, I saw the old man hammering at an anvil, completely absorbed in his work.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Hey, Grandpa!” I called, but the noise of metal drowned out my voice. After a few more attempts, he finally noticed me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Turning with a smile, he said, “Oh, hello, dear! I just finished your armor, made a few upgrades, and crafted you a new sword!”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Really? A new sword?” I asked, surprised.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He nodded and handed me the long sword. The leather-wrapped hilt fit perfectly in my hand, the blade gleaming and well-balanced. I swung it, amazed by its weightless feel. It was perfect.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Incredible! I love it!” I said, grinning from ear to ear.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The old man’s face lit up. “I’m glad to hear it! Just need to add some finishing touches. It’ll be flawless when I’m done.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I nodded, handing the sword back. He suggested I wait in the living room while he wrapped things up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wandering through the living room, I noticed a peculiar book on a shelf. The lettering along the spine caught my eye—I think it was in Elvish. Curious, I pulled it down and opened it, only to find the pages blackened and brittle. Each one crumbled at the lightest touch. Frowning, I tried another book. The same result—burnt and ruined. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">My suspicion deepened. </span><span class="c3 c6">Why keep these charred books? </span><span class="c0">Before I could dwell on it, Gramps entered with a proud smile, holding up the finished sword. Its sleek black blade seemed to hum with power.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“I call it the Fighter’s Spirit!” he announced, swinging the sword with practiced ease. “As the name suggests, it responds to the courage one has! The more courageous the lighter and bigger it may grow. However someone who is a coward will pull out a dagger that is hard to swing” he let out an amused laugh.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I hid my unease behind a smile. “It’s beautiful. Thank you.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As I prepared to leave, Gramps stopped me with one last remark. “Oh, one more thing. That blade’s part of a set. The other belongs to a strong lady, much like yourself. If you find her, tell her Omar says hello.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I raised an eyebrow but nodded. “Alright, will do,” I said with a soft laugh.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Stepping outside, I took a deep breath, the weight of the new sword resting comfortably on my back. I made my way through the busy streets, the encounter with Gramps lingering in my mind. Brushing off the unease, I soon spotted the leaf-head, standing near the entrance of an inn.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16 c8 c6 c17">Deta’s View</span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c3 c6 c8"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I felt a tap on my back, “Hey Bushy. What are you up to?” I turned, recognizing Gwen’s voice, but her appearance caught me off guard. She looked strikingly different from the last time I saw her. Her once battered, grimy armor was replaced with clean clothes, and her thick, curly hair appeared vibrant.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Gwen? Is that really you?” I asked, still taken aback.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She rolled her eyes, “Yes, it’s me, you Leaf Head!”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I chuckled at her response, but it came out more nervous than I intended. I tried to shake off the awkwardness, realizing I hadn’t recognized her right away. It was a bit embarrassing, but I hoped she wouldn’t notice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Well, I’m glad you’re looking better! You’re almost unrecognizable without all the dirt and blood.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen’s expression shifted, arms folding across her chest. “Rude,” she said, turning away.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I panicked, thinking I’d crossed a line. “Wait! I-That’s not what-”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She smiled, rolling her eyes. “I swear, Bushy... So, what are you up to?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I gave a nervous grin and explained I was on the hunt for the Demon Knight and her partner, Beans.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Beans?” Gwen tried to stifle a laugh, her shoulders shaking. “That’s... an unfortunate name.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I stood there, puzzled as she kept giggling.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“What’s wrong with his name?” I asked, still not getting it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen patted my shoulder like I was a bit slow on the uptake. “Ah, Leaf Head. You’ll figure it out,” she said, walking ahead with a smirk playing at her lips. “You coming? I want to explore this new kingdom,” she called back, her smile both teasing and inviting.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I shook my head, still unsure why she found it so funny, but followed anyway. There was something about her that made me feel like I was missing the punchline.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16 c8 c6 c17">Beans’ View</span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c3 c8 c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bluma and I were walking up the castle tower, climbing the endless stairs. My legs burned with each step, my breath coming in ragged bursts as the weight of the climb wore on. I was starting to feel every inch of my dwarven frame—short legs and lack of stamina didn’t exactly make stair-climbing easy. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As I grew weary, Bluma hoisted me onto her back without a second thought. I didn’t protest; I was too tired to do anything but sigh in relief, grateful for the help. Carrying me was effortless for her, and I felt deeply grateful.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Sorry, Bluma... I don't mean to be a burden," I said with a hint of regret.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bluma kept walking but turned her head to me. "Good," she replied in a bright and cheerful tone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After ascending a bit further, we reached the door we were searching for. Bluma set me down and pushed it open. The room stretched about thirty feet across, lined with tables and shelves crammed with scrolls and ancient scripts.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"> A few chests brimming with documents sat in the corners, but they weren’t our concern; we had come to speak to the King's sorcerer, Burlog so that he could advise us on some sort of tracking spell. People had been disappearing from the kingdom lately, no clues, no mess, just gone. The princess being the most recent. If this keeps up the kingdom may fall before the change of season, for it won't take long before they choose to go after the King and Queen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Burlog," Bluma called, her voice clear and commanding, ensuring he knew we had arrived.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We scanned the room but saw no sign of him. Suddenly, something tumbled from the ceiling. I looked up, and a smile spread across my face. "Hello, Burlog!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Burlog chuckled. He was sprawled out on the roof, some of his belongings spilling from his black robes. "Greetings, Squire Beans and Demon Knight!" he sighed, a grin crossing his face. "I attempted one of the scrolls... seems I might’ve read it wrong."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I let out a laugh. "Looks like it! How do we get you down?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Burlog glanced around and pointed toward a potion on his desk. "Grab that bottle and toss it at me! It’s a dispelling potion!" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I picked up the potion and handed it to Bluma with a wide grin. "Here you go, my lady!" Bluma gave me a light pat on the head before throwing the potion at Burlog. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The bottle shattered against him, and he immediately began plummeting toward the floor. Bluma dashed forward, catching him before he hit the ground, and set him down gently.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Oh, thank you! Forgot how to land," Burlog laughed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"> Burlog turned to Bluma. "So, How can I assist? I do have an order from the Queen but I'm sure I can make time for the kingdom's best knight."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I cleared my throat and spoke up. “Have you heard of the recent disappearances?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Burlog let out a heavy sigh. “Yes. Very tragic. Those poor knights and soldiers…”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“I know, some were good friends of ours.” I hesitated before adding, “Thankfully the princess has returned.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Burlog’s face brightened. “Ah, now that is good news! I was beginning to worry we had lost her too.” He shook his head, relief evident in his voice. “The kingdom needs her if something were to ever happen to her parents.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bluma gave a firm nod. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before the moment could settle I got eager and asked, “Do you think you could whip up a tracking scroll for us?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Burlog rolled his eyes as he turned to me with a flat expression. “You think magic is as easy as making bread, child?”  He sighed, rubbing his temples. “That said… it's not impossible. But it’ll take time.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He then went to one of his cluttered shelves, bottles rolling and clinging together as he dug through it and pulled out a parchment. “That said, it won't do you much good without having a suspect to pin it on. However I think I have a pretty good idea as to who it is.” Burlog continued, " from what I’ve pieced together, I believe it could be Rinn, the Dark Elf."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Bluma wasn’t surprised to hear Rinn’s name and as Burlog went off into an explanation as to why, I surveyed the room. My gaze rested on what looked to be a Dwarven scroll with the seal of the Queen on it. Curious, I picked it up and scanned its contents. </span><span class="c3 c8 c6">Why would the Queen put her seal on a Dwarvish scroll of all things? Why is it here in the first place?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Still absorbed in his explanation, Bluma glanced over at me with her four golden eyes, she too noticed the seal and the fact that it was Dwarvish. As she approached, she saw the color drain from my face as if I had seen a ghost. Before I could say anything, Burlog strode over and snatched the paper from my hands.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Easy there, kid! We don’t need you floating to the ceiling too!" Burlog gave a nervous laugh.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I stared at him, seriousness in my eyes. "That wasn’t a spell, sir. It looked like a hit list..." I turned to Bluma, my voice trembling slightly. "It had the names of all the missing people, including the Royal knights and the princess!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bluma extended her hand toward Burlog, silently demanding the paper.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Burlog hesitated, his gaze fixed on me. "No, child. Keep your mouth shut," he muttered with a mix of annoyance and disdain. "The grown-ups are talking!" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although his words stung, I pressed on. "Also, the list had the names of the remaining royal family, the other guards, and even... me--"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Silence, child!" he bellowed, his voice echoing through the room.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I stepped back, my fists clenched, glaring at him. "I’m not a child! I’m a Dwarf!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Burlog’s expression darkened, and his hand began to tremble, a deep, furious red light glowing from his palm. "Dwarfs and children are the same!" he sneered, his voice dripping with contempt. "Both filthy, worthless creatures!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Burlog's rage intensified, and he began muttering incantations, preparing to unleash a devastating spell on me. Before he could finish, Bluma, sensing the danger, surged forward, grabbing his arm and flinging him across the room with a forceful throw.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Burlog slammed into the stone wall with a heavy thud, crumpling to the floor. Groaning, he pushed himself up, eyes blazing with fury. Bluma, standing protectively in front of me, had her great sword drawn, the light gleaming off its edge. Her expression was hard, her voice fierce.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Squishy," she said, as though reminding me she would always protect me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Burlog dusted off his tattered robe and let out a deep, frustrated sigh. "I am sick of being pushed around!" he shouted. "I should be the one in charge! I possess magic! I have the power of the Fallen One! The King is weak! Too soft! He doesn’t have what it takes to defend this kingdom!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I glared at him, disgust welling up inside me. "You're nothing more than a madman obsessed with power!" I spat, my voice trembling with fury. "You’re willing to harm innocent people for your own selfish gain!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Burlog’s eyes darkened with fury. He extended his hand, and the stone beneath Bluma’s feet shifted and twisted, transforming into a giant hand that grabbed her. Bluma, caught off guard, struggled to break free, but the enchanted stone held her in its unyielding grip. My heart sank as I watched her struggle. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Bluma!" I screamed, terror gripping me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Without thinking, I pulled out my hand ax, anger surging through me. I glared at Burlog, who wore a twisted smile. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"How dare you touch her!" I roared, my voice cracking with emotion as I hurled the ax with all my might. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The ax buried itself deep into his shoulder before he could react, a scream of pain tearing from his throat. Blood soaked his robes as he stumbled, summoning lightning to his remaining hand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With fury burning in his eyes, Burlog swung at me, his hand crackling with electricity. I managed to dodge the first strike, but in my haste, I tripped and fell. Burlog saw his opportunity and grabbed me by the throat, lifting me off the ground. Pain surged through my body as he electrocuted me, my scream echoing through the chamber. My limbs went numb, and my vision blurred as I felt consciousness slipping away.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just before everything went black, I saw Bluma. She had shattered the stone hand that held her and was charging at Burlog, her face a mask of pure rage. Burlog, sensing the imminent danger, conjured a fireball and hurled it toward her. The explosion was deafening, flames engulfing the room. He laughed, believing he had won.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But as the smoke cleared, his laughter died. Bluma was still standing, just inches from him, her sword raised high. With a single, powerful swing, she severed his remaining arm and one of his legs. Burlog’s scream was blood-curdling as he tumbled down the staircase, finally crashing at the bottom, unconscious.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bluma, panting from exertion, rushed to my side. She cradled me carefully, checking my pulse, and breathed a sigh of relief when she felt it. Without wasting any time, she lifted me in her arms and carried me out of the room, heading down the stairs we had climbed earlier.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As she carried me, I drifted in and out of consciousness, slipping into a memory—one I hadn't thought about in years. The day Bluma and I first met.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16 c8 c6 c17">Some Years Ago</span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c3 c8 c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I dreamt when I was just seventeen years old, dressed in shabby clothes with holes in my shirt and pants. I was working tirelessly in my family's field, which had become extremely tough and dry. It had been a rough year for us as the soil had lost its nourishment, but I refused to give up. Every day, I kept working with the hope that things would eventually improve. Later that day, my father called for me to come inside as we had some unexpected visitors.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Coming, father!" I shouted, as I made my way back home.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I couldn't help but wonder who these visitors could be. We hadn't planned for anyone to come over. I shrugged and continued walking, my mind buzzing with curiosity.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As I entered the kitchen through the back door, I called out to my father in a loud voice, "Yes, Father?" I kicked the dirt off my shoes and made my way to the living room, eager to know who the unexpected visitors were. And there they were - Royal knights standing in the living room.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My father cleared his throat, his long black beard wobbling as he spoke. "Beans, sit down. The knights have something important to discuss with us."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I felt a wave of anxiety wash over me, fearing that they were going to draft us into some war. </span><span class="c3 c6">Were there any wars going on? No, I don't think so. Why are they here?</span><span class="c0"> I sat down on the chair next to a family picture, the warmth of the memory doing little to calm my nerves. I tried hard to contain my flatulence, an odd yet very real concern in the midst of everything else. The more I focused on it, the more difficult it became. It was like my body was staging a rebellion against my attempts to remain composed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The knights exchanged glances and nodded in unison. "We thank you for your hospitality," spoke the first knight with a firm but amicable tone. "As emissaries of the king, we have been tasked with a special request for the nearby farms."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was also intrigued by the knights' request and listened intently as my father asked for more details. "What might that request be?" he asked, his tone polite yet assertive. The knights were about to respond when the front door suddenly swung open, revealing my mother's arrival.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Sorry I'm late, sweetheart!" she exclaimed, her voice bubbling with a mix of excitement and exhaustion. "The main district was so busy today, but I think I got the right tools for us to try…" She smiled, unaware of the knights in the room at first.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But as soon as her eyes landed on them, her expression shifted to one of shock. She gasped, her hands instinctively rising to cover her mouth in disbelief. "Oh my goodness, I'm so sorry!" she stammered, bowing slightly. "I didn't realize… What can I do to help?" She straightened up, her nerves kicking in, but she quickly composed herself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The knights reassured her that there was no need for apologies and proceeded to explain their mission. They informed us that the King was hiring all the nearby farmers, as he knew they were having trouble with their crops. If they were to accept the king's offer, they would be paid fifty gold and given a fertility spell scroll to assist in the planting season.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My father, mother, and I were flabbergasted by the offer—and we accepted it on the spot, barely giving the guard time to finish.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The guard gave a tight shrug. “It’s simple work, mostly. One of the King’s top knights is looking for a successor. Word got out, and now we’ve got half the realm trying to cram through the gates.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We followed his gaze to the distant swell of voices beyond the courtyard walls.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“They need help managing the crowd. Sorting names, keeping tempers down. Just for a few days.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Simple enough. At least it </span><span class="c3 c6">sounded</span><span class="c0"> that way.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With excitement bubbling in my chest and a grin stretched across my face, we boarded the cart and made our way toward the inner kingdom walls. The road beneath us gave way to polished stone, and the fields turned to brick and bustling energy. I leaned over the side, eyes wide as towers pierced the sky like spears of gold.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As we drew closer, the kingdom unfolded before us in a blur of motion and color. People darted between wagons and tents, calling out over the clatter of wheels and the bark of orders. The air was thick with the scent of fresh bread, manure, and something metallic—maybe blood, maybe steel. Flags snapped in the wind above market stalls, and scaffolding creaked under the weight of hurried workers preparing for the surge of visitors.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I had never seen anything like it. Never imagined a place so alive. Our little farm felt like a faded dream in comparison, a quiet world of soil and silence traded for stone and noise and fire.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For the first four days, everything went surprisingly smoothly. My mother tended to injured contestants with a steady hand and kind words, while my father kept things running—checking rosters, smoothing disputes, directing traffic like he’d been doing it all his life.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I, on the other hand, was given the noble task of sweeping.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Which, honestly, I didn’t mind at all. The best part of the job was that I had a perfect view of the tryouts.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Demon Knight herself stood at the center of it all, searching for a new apprentice. Each day, contestants stepped into the ring with fire in their eyes—fighters, spellcasters, strategists—each with their own plan to unseat her. The rules were simple: move her from her spot by any means.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But no one could.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She didn’t dodge. She didn’t block. She didn’t even flinch. And still, no matter how they came at her, none of them could make her take even a single step.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was terrifying. And mesmerizing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">As I watched the fights, I couldn't help but feel fortunate to be there. I thought to myself, </span><span class="c3 c6">I'm so lucky to have come to the kingdom and witness the greatest knight of all time spar with people! Just look at her!</span><span class="c0"> The Demon Knight stopped someone's blade and threw them across the ring.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I smiled and sighed, "She's so cool…" My heart raced with excitement as I watched the thrilling battles unfold before me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I was so enraptured that I didn’t notice </span><span class="c3">as one</span><span class="c0"> of the king's knights approached me and interrupted my view. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Hey, I know you're enjoying the fights, but an accident occurred in the preparation barracks. Could you clean it up?" he asked. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I nodded and replied, "Of course! I'll head there right away!" I then quickly made my way towards the preparation barracks, where one of the contestants had vomited after their fight with the Demon Knight.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Though I was not happy to clean it up, I did so anyway because I wanted to stay and watch more. As I cleaned, the other contestants laughed at me for my size and for being the one tasked with cleaning up the mess. However, I didn't let it bother me. I was just happy to be there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just as I was about to leave, one of the contestants shouted after me, “Hey, cleaning boy! Go fetch!” He laughed as he kicked a clump of dirt and bits of trash straight into the ring.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I sighed, gripping the broom tighter. Frustration bubbled up in my chest, but I swallowed it down. I wasn’t strong enough to stand up to him—and besides, I didn’t want trouble.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Demon Knight, cheered on by the crowd, stood in the ring, waiting for her next challenger.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Muttering under my breath, I shuffled into the ring to sweep up the mess. “Every day it’s the same—sweep, sweep, sweep while they get all the glory…”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thud.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I bumped into someone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then silence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I blinked, confused, and glanced up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Demon Knight had staggered a half-step forward. She turned around slowly, her shadow falling over me. I stood there, broom still in hand, heart caught in my throat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“I—oh, sorry,” I stammered, not yet realizing. “I’ll just clean this and get out of your way—”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then I saw my parents, standing frozen at the far end of the ring, eyes wide with fear. My stomach dropped.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Mom? Dad? What’s—”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That’s when I realized.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Somehow, without noticing, I had stepped fully into the ring.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was standing face to face with the Demon Knight.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the crowd had seen it, too.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Laughter erupted from the stands. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“A kid? They’re letting kids try out now?” </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“He’s gonna die!” </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Get the mop outta here before she uses it to scrape him off her boots!”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I wanted to disappear. My legs locked in place. I’d seen what she could do—what she </span><span class="c3 c6">had</span><span class="c0"> done—and now I’d practically charged at her with a broom.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">From the edge of the ring, several knights scrambled in alarm. I saw them start to run, armor clanking, faces pale with panic. They knew I wasn’t supposed to be there. They knew what might happen next.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I backed away, heart hammering, and bowed low in apology. “I—I’m so sorry! I didn’t mean to interrupt you! I’m just the cleaner!”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Demon Knight stepped forward.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I flinched.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She crouched down, meeting me at eye level. Her piercing gaze scanned my face, quiet and unreadable. Then, without warning, she reached out and ruffled my hair.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Squishy,” she said softly, like it was the most natural word in the world.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The crowd fell silent again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">And just like that, the fear melted off of me. A warm, tingling calm spread through my chest and down to my toes. I didn’t understand it—but I knew </span><span class="c3">at that</span><span class="c0"> moment, she wasn’t going to hurt me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She wasn’t angry.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">She was... curious.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">My parents hugged each other and shed tears of happiness, knowing that their son was going to have a prosperous life under the protection of the legendary Demon Knight. </span><span class="c3">As she walked away pulling on my collar,</span><span class="c0"> dragging me off away from the ring.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Overwhelmed by the turn of events, I stuttered out a question: "Y-you chose... me?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She nodded, her face unreadable. I felt a tear roll down my cheek, but quickly wiped it away. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Could I... could I ask for your name?" I asked in a hushed tone. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Demon Knight glanced around before whispering back, "Bluma." She patted my head gently before turning and walking away. I hesitated for a moment, then followed her into the hallway, excited for what was to come.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16 c6 c17">Presen</span><span class="c16 c6 c17">t</span><span class="c16 c8 c17 c22"> </span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The memory faded as I opened my eyes to find myself back in the Barracks. Bluma was sitting beside me, sorting through a collection of potions. When she noticed I was awake, she gave me a small nod. "Awake?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I chuckled softly. "Yeah, I’m awake." I glanced around the room, spotting the familiar photos on the bedside table—pictures of me and my parents, and one of Bluma and me after our first mission together.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"It’s hard to believe it’s been seven years," I said with a smile, feeling a swell of gratitude. "The best seven years of my life!" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bluma looked away for a moment before nodding in agreement. "Rest," she said as she helped me lie back down and covered me with the blankets. I chuckled and reluctantly agreed. As I lay there, I still felt the same warm feeling that I always had whenever I was near Bluma. I never wanted this feeling to go away.</span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><hr/><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><h5 class="c7 c23" id="h.1t3h5sf"><span class="c21">CHAPTER 6</span><span class="c13 c8">                                                                                                                          Some Love to Spare</span></h5><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16 c6 c17">Deta’s View</span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen and I had made our way from the inn and already found the kingdom to be surprisingly peaceful and quaint. Despite the constant hum of voices and the steady clatter of footsteps on cobblestone, there was a gentle rhythm to everything—vendors calling out in friendly tones, laughter drifting from nearby alleys, the scent of fresh bread wafting through the air. Even the guards strolled more than marched. It was a city that breathed easy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“I see a lot of humans around… but not many of the other races,” I said, slowing my pace as I glanced around. The crowds bustled past—faces flushed with laughter, arms full of goods—but almost all of them were human. It hadn't struck me before, but now that I was paying attention, the absence stood out like a missing color in a painting.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen gave a quick roll of her eyes. "That's because this is a human kingdom. Most races stick with their own kind."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I nodded in agreement, trying to make sense of the place. "So, you’re comfortable here since you’re human, right?" Based on her appearance, I figured this was a safe assumption.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen's expression shifted immediately. Her eyebrow arched, her words came out sharp. "What do you mean by that?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I blinked, surprised by her reaction. "I mean, since you're human, and we’re in a human kingdom..." I trailed off, unsure of where I had gone wrong.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen cut me off, her voice sharper now. "And what makes you think that?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My mind raced, trying to figure out what I had missed. "I... I thought you were human. Aren’t you?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She scrubbed her hands over her face and let out a sigh. "You know what, it doesn’t matter. Don’t label me, Bushy." With that, she turned and walked down a quieter street, away from the bustling crowd.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">"Label? What did I do?" I muttered to myself, completely confused. But with no clear answer in sight, I sighed and followed after her,</span><span class="c36"> </span><span class="c5 c6">Alright, she did not like that. I will not bring it up again. But if she isn't human, what could she be?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The small street, narrow and slightly winding, led us into a quiet, residential neighborhood, where the houses stood close together, their gardens bursting with overgrown vines and bright flowers. The sound of laughter filled the air, punctuated by the rhythmic clash of the wooden swords as three children pretended to be brave knights, their faces flushed with excitement. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Come back here!" one of them shouted, grinning from ear to ear. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"You will never catch me, hero! I am the Frost Lord!" The Frost Lord pretended to throw something and then the hero pulled some feathers from his pocket and tossed them into the air.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Oh no! My body is frozen! What shall I do?" he said dramatically, pretending to faint.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I chuckled at their antics, curious to see what they would do next.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen rolled her eyes “Let’s go,” she whispered, with a wave of her hand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Why? They look like they are having fun!” I responded whilst watching them continue to play.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3"> </span><span class="c3">A little</span><span class="c0"> girl's voice suddenly caught my attention. "I will save you, hero!" she called out from atop a crate, wearing a bucket on her head. She jumped down with a stuffed animal that looked like a bear-bird hybrid and declared, "Get him!" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Throwing the toy at the Frost Lord, he caught it with a grin. "Oh no! The monster has got me! Ah!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The little girl giggled as she removed her bucket and brushed away the feathers from the hero's feet. "Thank you, miss! Now let us defeat him!" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She beamed, "Yes! And be free from the cold!" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Together, they charged toward the Frost Lord, drawing their swords. The girl tapped him lightly on the arm, while the boy smacked him, causing him to cry out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Frost Lord started crying as the hero had hit him a bit too hard with his wooden sword. "Jacob!! That hurt!" he wailed, rubbing his eyes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jacob immediately dropped his sword and hugged the other boy. "Oh! Sorry, Aaron," he apologized.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c3">         </span><span class="c0">The little girl looked worried, her eyes wide and her grip tightening on her wooden sword as if it were a shield. I slowed my pace, trying not to startle her. I knelt down, lowering myself to her level. "Hey, are you alright, kid?" I asked, my voice gentle, hoping to bring some comfort.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">They </span><span class="c3">didn't</span><span class="c3"> answer, just stared at me with a mix of caution and uncertainty.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Who are you?" Aaron asked, still sniffling.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Gwen stood nearby, crossing her arms and leaning against the wall. “Here we go..” She said in an unenthusiastic whisper.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Smiling, I introduced myself. "My name is Deta." I knelt and pressed my hand to the dirt, coaxing a flower to bloom. The children gasped—eyes wide, mouths parted. The little girl bounced on her heels, squealing, "Wow! He can do magic!" Jacob leaned in close, grinning ear to ear. I laughed, their wonder infectious.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Curious, I turned to Aaron and asked, "What's your name, kid?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He hesitated before replying, "My name is Aaron."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Nice to meet you, Aaron," I said with a smile. "Hey, could I see your arm for a moment?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Aaron looked puzzled but held out his arm for me to inspect. I noticed a painful bruise forming where Jacob had hit him with the wooden sword.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Ouch, that looks like it stings," I said, my voice full of sympathy. "Let me try something." I placed my hand over the bruise, closed my eyes, and focused on healing the injury. After a few moments, I removed my hand and smiled at Aaron.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"There, all better," I said softly, patting his arm.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Aaron glanced at his arm in amazement—the bruise was completely gone. "Wow, thank you!" Aaron exclaimed, grinning widely. The other children cheered in excitement, and I couldn't help but feel joyful seeing their smiles.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I smiled and said, "No problem!" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The little girl then turned her attention to Gwen, eyeing her sheathed sword. "</span><span class="c5">Why do you have a sword, lady?</span><span class="c0">" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen looked at the small girl and replied, "Yes, I do. What's your name?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The girl's face lit up as she answered, "I'm Sarah!" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen sighed a little and said, "Nice to meet you, Sarah… Would you like to see the sword?"</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">         Sarah eagerly nodded and exclaimed, "Yes, please!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen knelt down and said, "Go ahead, draw it out." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sarah grabbed the handle and pulled the longsword. "Wow, so cool!" she exclaimed, though quickly realizing it was too heavy for her to swing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"> "Careful, don't hurt yourself," Gwen cautioned. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She gently took the sword back from Sarah and sheathed it. "It’s dangerous, so we need to be careful," Gwen explained.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sarah nodded in agreement. "Okay!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jacob picked up his wooden sword and eagerly said, "Hey! Can we fight?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"> A jolt of surprise sparked through me."You want to fight?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He nodded enthusiastically.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I smiled "Um... all I have is this big stick, and you have that cool sword! I don't think I can win.</span><span class="c0">"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"> Jacob grinned. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Aaron, noticing the situation, offered his wooden sword and said, "Here! You can use mine!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I chuckled and thanked Aaron, taking the wooden sword from him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen pulled over a wooden box and sat down, saying with a wry smile, "This should be interesting." Sarah and Aaron sat next to her, their eyes gleaming with excitement.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"> Jacob smiled and charged at me, swinging his wooden sword with all his might. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">"Wow!"</span><span class="c0"> I dodged his attack, making him and the others laugh. He came at me again, and I blocked his strike.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Wow! You're so strong!" he exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I smiled, watching the way Jacob’s eyes lit up with determination. He laughed and shoved at me again, trying to push harder this time, like he really thought he could win. I let him think he might. There was something fun about pretending I was struggling—like I was part of his little game, not just humoring him. I stepped back a few paces, waiting until the last second before I jumped aside. He stumbled forward with a surprised yelp, and I couldn’t help but grin wider. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">"Hey!" he laughed, while Aaron and Sarah giggled. </span><span class="c3">Gwen let out a small sigh, but didn’t seem irritated. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jacob yelled again and swung at me, missing by inches. I let out a mock scream and bolted, arms flailing as I ran in exaggerated circles around the yard. He chased after me, laughing between shouts of "Get back here!" while the others shrieked and cheered like it was the best game in the world.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I called out, "Ah! Run away!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sarah and Aaron were laughing as they watched, and they then asked if they could join in. Jacob agreed right away, and they all turned toward me, grinning. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Uh oh. They are after me!" I giggled </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They screamed and chased after me. I ran ahead of them and then turned around, lifting my arms. "Now I’m going to catch you!" I declared. They paused, giggling, before turning and running away, shrieking with laughter. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sarah, being younger and a bit slower, began to panic, calling out, "Jacob, help!" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jacob stopped and grabbed her hand, and they ran together.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Charmed by their teamwork, I gave a soft chuckle but picked up my pace just enough to close the space between us. I hunched forward, and reached to gently touch Sarah’s hair making her jump and shout, "Ah! Faster!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She let out a shriek and cried out to Jacob, “Ah! Faster!”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They didn't pick up the pace, but I pretended to slow down, letting them think they were outpacing me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They ran to a box and clung to it, shouting, "Base! Base!" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I stopped and laughed. "Aw man, you win!" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">We all laughed until a woman's voice called out, "</span><span class="c3">Aaron</span><span class="c0">, Jacob, Sarah! Time to come back!" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It sounded like their mother confirmed it when Jacob yelled, “Okay, Mom!”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sarah echoed him a moment later, and the two of them hurried off together.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"> Aaron stood up and thanked Gwen, which caught her a bit off guard—she hadn’t done anything. Not really. She blinked, unsure how to respond, unsure why anyone would be thanking her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I called after him, "Hey, wait! You forgot something!"</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">         He turned around, saw his wooden sword, and ran back to grab it. "Thanks!" he shouted, before dashing off again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I waved. "No problem! Bye, Aaron!" He smiled as he ran.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">         Gwen stood up and remarked, "They liked you."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I turned to her, smiling. "Well, back home, I used to play with baby deer, and we’d do similar things." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen raised an eyebrow. "You’re an odd one, I’ll give you that." She started walking, and I followed behind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Being weird is fun," I exclaimed. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She sighed, her tone dripping with doubt. "Uh huh. Sure." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before I could reply, our attention was pulled toward a commotion in the distance. We saw a small, elderly woman frantically waving a giant pot around while yelling, "Whoa... whoa, careful... watch out!" The pot, somehow set loose, teetered and wobbled wildly across the cobblestones, barreled toward us, but Gwen swiftly extended her arm, grabbing the top of the pot to stop it in its tracks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Thank you," the old woman said, peeking out from behind the pot. She was a petite figure, barely four feet tall, with a large hair bun streaked with gray, white, and hints of brown. Her oversized glasses perched on her nose, and her simple clothing added to her modest appearance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">"No problem," Gwen replied, her eyes narrowing as</span><span class="c3"> </span><span class="c0">she glanced at the cart stacked high with pottery, probably for her store brimming with large pottery. "Why isn't your husband helping you with all this?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The old woman sighed deeply, a wave of sorrow passing over her features before she spoke. "He died many years ago from the plague…"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen’s expression softened as she cast her eyes down. "I'm so sorry…" she murmured.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I stepped closer, offering my own condolences. "That must have been incredibly difficult for you…"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The woman nodded, her voice tinged with quiet grief. "Yes… my four boys were taken from me too… so I've been on my own for many, many years."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I hesitated, thinking how lonely that must’ve been—to lose her family. "Would you mind if we helped you?" I asked, hoping to offer more than just words.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The old woman’s eyes widened in surprise. "Oh no, I couldn’t ask that of you."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I chuckled gently and said, “No, really, it’s no trouble. We’d be happy to help, right, Gwen?” I turned to Gwen with a grin. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Sure…” she replied, sounding less than enthusiastic. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The woman’s eyes filled with tears as she whispered, “Thank you. It means so much to this old lady.” She laughed softly, wiping her eyes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I clapped my hands together. “Alright, let’s get these pots inside!”</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16 c8 c6 c17">Gwen’s View</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c3 c8 c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As I moved toward the cart, I glanced back at the woman. “Why do you need so many pots?” I asked. It was a lot. Even for someone running a shop.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">She smiled faintly. "This is how I make my living. I’ve never been good at heavy labor, but I’ve always been skilled with my hands." Then, with a small laugh, she added, “If my husband were still around, you could ask him.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I gave a short nod. "Cool. So, where do you want this?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I grabbed one of the taller pots—thing was almost as big as me—and followed her inside. It was a tight fit through the doorway, but I managed not to slam it into anything. The room was packed with pottery—bowls, plates, weird animal statues. “Quite the collection,” I said, mostly to say something.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She brightened up. "Yes, it’s what’s kept me going all these years. Could you place that one over there in the corner?" She pointed toward a spot near some other large pots.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I headed over and set it down carefully. Then I heard a click under the base. My brow creased. That wasn’t normal.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A faint sliding noise came from behind me, followed by a dull thunk. I turned. The floor had opened up. Of course it had. There was a box inside. And a note. Because nothing in this town could ever just be simple. “Naturally,” I muttered.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Deta came in right then, arms full of smaller pots. "Where do you want these, ma'am?" they asked, chipper as ever.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“By the fireplace, dear,” the old woman said. Then she noticed me lingering by the open floor. “Did something catch your eye, love?”</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">I shrugged. “Not really.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She followed my gaze anyway, spotted the compartment, and crouched down to check it out. "What’s this now?" she mumbled, pulling out the box and the note. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"I don’t remember putting this here..." she murmured, brushing dust from the box. "My husband must’ve hidden it long ago." She unfolded the note, her eyes scanning it briefly. “It’s... a reminder to smile when things get hard,” she said quietly, her voice cracking. “He used to leave little notes like this everywhere.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She turned it over in her hands, found the keyhole, and wound it up. The top popped open with a soft click, revealing a button inside.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her face softened like she'd just stumbled across an old memory. "My late husband was a musician, you know. He played the Tubanarium." She motioned to a photo on the wall—some guy with a shiny bell-shaped instrument. "He used to play for the neighborhood kids. Our eldest, Philly, picked it up too. Traveled around. Sent letters for a while, then stopped when work got busy."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She took off her glasses and wiped her eyes. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I looked at the photo. There was something kind of nice about it, but I didn’t linger. “What’s your name?” I asked, keeping it casual.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She laughed quietly. "Oh, I’m sorry. I must be getting old. My name is Elewen, but everyone calls me Eve."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Nice to meet you, Eve,” I said. “Looks like Bushy over there’s done hauling your stuff in.”</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16 c8 c6 c17">Deta’s View</span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c3 c8 c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Eve looked over, laughing at the sight of me with two pots comically stuck on my hands. </span><span class="c3">I had been arranging the smaller pieces to resemble a goat.</span><span class="c0"> "Very creative," Eve said, her chuckling making me jump in surprise, which only made her laugh more.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Thank you," I replied, grinning as I freed my hands. "I brought in the rest of your things, so you won’t need to worry about them."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Eve smiled warmly, patting my hand. When she let go, I felt something small in my palm. Opening my hand, I saw an amber-colored rock. Curious, I licked it, and my taste buds were hit with a mix of sweetness and savory flavor. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"It’s called a caramel drop," Eve explained with a chuckle. "You put it in your cheek and let it melt. Like this." She popped another one into her mouth, so I did the same. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My eyes widened with delight. "This is incredible!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Eve beamed. "I’m glad you like it," she said, handing a few to Gwen as well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As the evening drew closer, Eve glanced outside. "You two should get going—it’s starting to get dark." I looked at the sunset casting warm orange hues over the streets. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Oh, it is late," I admitted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen rolled her eyes but turned to Eve with a smile. "It was a pleasure meeting you. I hope everything goes well." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Eve smiled back, mouthing the words "thank you" as she disappeared around the corner, she reached back and pushed the button on the music box. Soft, enchanting music filled the room—like something meant to linger long after she was gone. and soft, enchanting music filled the room.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen and I stepped outside, savoring the caramel drops. "This caramel is amazing! How have I never heard of it before?" I exclaimed. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen sighed. "You haven’t been out in the world much, have you?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I shook my head. "Not really, but I have to bring some back home for Vomete!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen nodded, popping another caramel into her mouth. "Mm... yeah, this is good," she admitted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Told you!" I said, smiling. She rolled her eyes again but didn’t argue.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As we continued walking, something terrifying caught my eye. Approaching us at an alarming speed was a creature making strange noises. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Mivomafisockmas, Mivomafisockmas!!" I screamed, instinctively taking a few steps back, and Gwen, seeing my panic, gripped the hilt of her sword and scanned our surroundings.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"What's wrong!?" she asked. I pointed at the approaching monster.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Gwen looked in the direction I pointed, then back at me, bursting into laughter. "You've got to be kidding me! You're scared of </span><span class="c3 c6">that</span><span class="c0"> thing?" She doubled over, still chuckling. "It's just a snail, Bushy. What’s so terrifying about it?" She sauntered over to the snail, picked it up, and pretended to fling it at my face. I let out a startled scream, stumbling backward and landing flat on the ground. Her laughter turned into wheezing as she clutched her sides. "Bushy, afraid of a snail? That's gold. What were you even trying to say?" She tossed the snail away with a laugh.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I brushed myself off, still feeling the sting of embarrassment. "Well… I said </span><span class="c3 c6">Mivomafisockmas, </span><span class="c0">It is a phrase in my tongue…  but literally means comfort… I say it when I’m scared." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen, still recovering from her laughter, apparently not listening. "Just a snail," she repeated, giggling. "That was priceless." She walked over and  playfully slapped my back. "Don’t worry, the terrifying creature has been vanquished!" Her laughter bubbled up again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Do you even know what snails eat? Worms, bugs, and greens! And I’m practically made of greens!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As her laughter died down, she gave me a teasing smile. "It was just a tiny snail. Do you honestly think it could kill you?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Yes!" I replied, dead serious.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen chuckled and shook her head. "Alright, alright. Don’t get your vines in a knot." She added, "I’ll be your fearless protector from the evil snails, Bushy," with another laugh.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I sighed, shaking my head. "Thanks, I guess."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Still chuckling, we continued our walk as the day wound down. The streets grew quieter as children headed home, and shopkeepers locked up for the night. The night guards began their shifts as the large, full moon rose over the horizon, illuminating the kingdom in soft, silvery light. The stars twinkled overhead, and knights lit pedestals along the inner walls and paths, casting a warm, orange glow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Looking up at the night sky, I felt a wave of homesickness wash over me. Back home, Vomete and I would take evening walks, and she’d tell me all about the stars—their origins, meanings, and the stories they held. Those moments were always magical. Gwen, too, found herself lost in the beauty of the starry sky. It had been so long since she’d taken a moment to admire it. Her quiet contemplation, however, was interrupted by a low-hanging sign that smacked her right in the face. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Ow!" she yelped, rubbing her forehead. "Stupid sign!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I couldn’t help but laugh. "Sorry about that, Gwen. I don’t think the sign knew it was in your way."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen glared at me, her voice dripping with sarcasm. "Haha, very funny." She kept walking, still rubbing her head.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I grinned. "Come on, you have to admit it was a </span><span class="c3 c6">little</span><span class="c0"> funny." But as I continued to laugh, I tripped over another sign lying on the ground. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Gwen chuckled. "Yeah, I guess it </span><span class="c3 c6">is</span><span class="c0"> a little funny."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">After dusting myself off again, we continued walking until we found ourselves standing in front of a place called </span><span class="c3 c6">The Boiling Potion,</span><span class="c0"> nestled between the outer gates of the kingdom and some sort of an animal shop. Lively chatter and bursts of laughter poured out of the building, and I couldn’t help but wonder why humans always seemed so loud. Didn’t they enjoy peace and quiet? They were constantly talking over one another.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Curious, I studied the sign hanging outside the door, which displayed the name of the establishment in several different languages. "The Boiling… Potion?" I asked, puzzled. "Is this some kind of… shop?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Gwen's face lit up in excitement. "No, it’s a tavern!" she declared, clearly eager to get inside. Without waiting for me, she strode through the front doors, fully ready to immerse herself in the lively atmosphere within.</span><hr/></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><h5 class="c7 c23" id="h.4d34og8"><span class="c21">CHAPTER 7</span><span class="c13 c8">                                                                                                                Drunken Promise </span></h5><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16 c8 c6 c14">Bluma’s View</span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c5 c8 c6 c14"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I left the barracks and made my way to the upper district, where preparations for Liberty Day were well underway. The streets buzzed with energy as the citizens set up decorations, and colorful banners fluttered in the breeze. For over a thousand years—exactly one thousand one hundred eleven, to be precise—the people had celebrated this day with joy. It served as a reminder of the challenges their ancestors faced during the Frost Era, a time of great hardship, and the hope and abundance they now enjoyed in a land filled with life and light.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">As I walked, I came across the Kingdom's oldest building: </span><span class="c3 c6">The Leaping Lantern.</span><span class="c0"> I stepped inside to find that it still retained its Frost Era charm. The walls, carved from a natural cave, gave the place a rugged feel, while the floor and ceiling were covered with wooden beams. Some floorboards had broken over time, exposing thick wool insulation beneath them, a reminder of the days when keeping warmth in and the cold out was a matter of survival.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The moment I entered, the tavern fell silent. All eyes were on me, the Demon Knight, a figure known throughout the land. I moved with quiet purpose, and the patrons watched her with a mix of curiosity and caution. I took a seat in a corner booth, my gaze sweeping the room. A simple wave of my hand was all it took for the crowd to return to their conversations, though they kept their voices low and their eyes alert.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moments later, Deta’s companion burst through the doors, with Deta trailing behind.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16 c8 c6 c17">Deta’s View</span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c3 c8 c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Ah, this looks like a place to fight!" Gwen declared with a grin, her voice brimming with excitement.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I sighed, already anticipating the trouble. "Come on, Gwen, we already got kicked out of the last place because you started a fight. We didn’t even get to sit down!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She rolled her eyes, clearly unbothered. "So what? That fight was glorious!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shaking my head in disbelief, I noticed the Demon Knight sitting quietly at the back of the room. "Gwen, let's sit over there," I said, gesturing toward the empty seats at Bluma’s table. I grabbed her hand and led the way, dragging Gwen along.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Hey, Demon Knight, mind if we join you?" I asked politely, hoping Bluma wouldn't object to our company.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A few tavern patrons turned to see how this encounter would play out. Bluma seemed to study us for a moment, then nodded, motioning to the empty seats at her table. I smiled in gratitude and plopped into one of the chairs, with Gwen following close behind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen leaned in toward Bluma, her eyes alight with interest. "You look like a warrior! What’s your name?" she asked, grinning eagerly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bluma’s four eyes narrowed as she sized Gwen up, her silence speaking volumes before she finally replied, "Bluma."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen’s grin widened. "Bluma, huh? Well, Bluma, how about a spar? I’d love to see which one of us is stronger!" she challenged, her voice full of enthusiasm.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bluma simply stared at Gwen, not offering a response. An awkward silence stretched between them until someone approached our table. Before I could speak, Gwen piped up, "We’ll take three of your strongest and largest drinks!" She tossed two gold coins onto the table, and the waiter nodded before hurrying away.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I blinked, confused. "Gwen? What did you just give her?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen turned to me, incredulous. "Are you serious? How dumb are you, Randeths? That was gold! I gave her money, and in return, she’ll bring us drinks. What do you even use as currency if you've never used gold before?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I smiled nervously. "Um… I’ve never actually paid for anything before. Vomete and I live on our own, so we just take care of ourselves." I realized she must have taken some of the golden circles from the cavern when I wasn't looking.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen stared at me, her disbelief evident. "Seriously!? Wow, that sounds amazing—living out in the woods with nothing to worry about." She laughed, clearly enjoying the idea, even though I knew the reality wasn’t quite so carefree.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before I could explain further, the person returned with three large wooden mugs filled with a pungent liquid that made my nose wrinkle. "What is this?" I asked, eyeing the drinks warily.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bluma turned toward me, her voice low. "Alcohol," she replied simply, before turning her attention back to Gwen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen, unconcerned, began chugging her drink without hesitation. I hesitated for a moment before taking a cautious sip of my own.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"So, Bluma, right?" I asked, setting my mug down and trying to steer the conversation in a more productive direction. "I think I mentioned a few days ago that the king has tasked me with forming a group to hunt down a creature in the castle’s dungeons. I was hoping to ask if you and Beans would consider helping us out?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bluma didn’t immediately respond. She studied me for a moment before her gaze drifted to the window, lost in thought. Just as I was about to speak again, Gwen slammed her empty mug onto the table with a loud thud, the sound cutting through the tavern’s din. Her face was flushed from the drink, a lopsided grin creeping across her lips. She leaned heavily toward me, her arm wrapping around my shoulders before I could react, her finger poking insistently at my side.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Gwen!?" I stammered, startled by her sudden burst of energy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her laughter spilled out, light and unsteady. "Oh, lighten up, Bushy!" she said between hiccups, her words slurring slightly as she gave me another poke. "You're so stiff." Her finger jabbed again, and she giggled, the hiccup that followed making her laugh harder. "C'mon, let’s have some fun!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before I could form a response, Gwen pushed herself to her feet. She swayed for a moment, catching her balance with a giggle before her eyes locked on the empty stage across the room. The tavern bustled with life, but Gwen’s focus was unwavering. With a reckless grin, she staggered her way to the stage, her movements unsteady but full of purpose.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I watched, frozen, as she turned to face the crowd. My heart sank as she cupped her hands around her mouth and shouted, "Hey, you lot! Does anyone here know how to play!?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">For a moment, the tavern seemed to pause, heads turning to her. A low groan escaped my throat as I lowered my head into my hands. </span><span class="c3 c6">Oh no. Not this again. Hopefully no one will respond.</span><span class="c0"> From the table next to us, a man stood up, his grin as wide as Gwen’s. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Why yes, madam, we do!" he called, motioning to his group—a mix of elves and orcs who looked all too eager to join her. Slowly, they rose, gathering their instruments as the anticipation in the room grew.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen’s eyes sparkled with excitement. "Alright! Get up here, and let's make some noise!" she called, clapping her hands together.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One by one, the musicians joined her on stage, tuning their instruments and testing strings as the rest of the tavern watched. A rhythmic beat filled the air, starting slow but quickly picking up speed. The lively music began to swirl through the room, drawing attention as feet tapped and heads bobbed in time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, to my shock, Gwen opened her mouth and began to sing. Her voice, clear and strong, filled the space, commanding everyone’s attention. For a moment, I forgot the anxiety bubbling in my chest. I just stared at her, her energy infectious, the music wrapping around the room like magic.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Despite everything, I couldn’t help but smile. Gwen's voice was absolutely captivating as she sang with passion and intensity, drawing the attention of everyone in the tavern. Her melodic voice filled the space, and the musicians supporting her only enhanced the enchanting atmosphere. It was as if time had slowed to a crawl, and everyone in the room was entranced by the mesmerizing music echoing from the stage, joining in with her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I smiled and let out a soft laugh, "Huh... that didn’t go as I expected. That's a good thing!" </span><span class="c3">I c</span><span class="c0">huckled and turned to Bluma, but she was nowhere in sight. Her cup sat empty, and her sword rested on the table before me. Puzzled, I glanced around the tavern, searching for her but without any luck. Letting out a sigh, I picked up her sword and studied it for a moment before turning back to the stage.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We spent several hours at the tavern, enjoying the music and the lively company of the other patrons. As the night wore on, Gwen drank more and more of the alcohol, leaving her barely able to stand by the time we decided to leave. The darkness outside made me decide to walk her back to the inn across town, Bluma's sword still in my hands.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When we arrived, Gwen tried to convince the innkeeper for more alcohol, but I quickly intervened. We managed to secure a room, and I encouraged Gwen to go in so we could rest for the night.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Fine... you're not my dad!" she blurted out, and I couldn't help but smile awkwardly, hoping not to disturb the other guests. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Okay, I'm not your dad, but it's time for bed," I replied, hoping she'd listen. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She groaned and muttered, "Alright, alright, don’t be such a stick in the mud, Vine Hair!" before stumbling into the room. She collapsed on the bed and instantly fell asleep.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I exhaled a sigh and began preparing for bed myself when I noticed Gwen was still strapped with her sword and carrying her bags. </span><span class="c3 c6">She probably doesn’t want those ruined,</span><span class="c0"> I thought, surveying the room. I carefully removed her bags and sword, but as soon as I touched the weapon, she punched me square in the face. I stumbled back, quickly realizing she was still sound asleep.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Great... that’s not fun," I mumbled, rubbing my sore cheek. Eventually, I managed to take off her gear, giving her sword a closer look as I did so. "I wonder what her blade looks like?" I mused, holding Bluma's long sword next to Gwen's shorter one. "They're about the same size," I concluded before setting them aside and finally crawling into my own bed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">As I drifted off to sleep, my mind slipped into a vivid dream.</span><span class="c0"> I saw my home, and there in the garden, Vomete stood alone. Suddenly, she looked toward the sky, appearing much younger, and then hurried inside. At that moment, a beam of light pierced through the sky, and a radiant entity descended from it. The being spoke, but Vomete couldn't understand its words. She asked, "What do you want from me?" The entity handed her a wrapped object and stroked it tenderly before vanishing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Vomete... What just happened? How did it know your name?" I called out, but there was no reply. As I tried to move closer, my body became painfully sluggish. I tripped and plunged into a pit, screaming for Vomete's help as my vision faded to black. I woke abruptly, sitting upright.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">"What... was that?" I asked aloud, my heart racing. </span><span class="c3 c6">Is Vomete okay? Was it real or just a nightmare?</span><span class="c0"> Shaking off the lingering thoughts, I got up and headed to the nearby washroom, splashing cold water on my face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Returning to the room, I saw Gwen still sound asleep. A smile tugged at my lips as I sat by the window. A familiar surge of energy coursed through me, and my vine-like hair sprouted fresh green leaves. "Ah... that’s better," I whispered contentedly. A rustling noise grabbed my attention, and I turned to see Gwen sitting up with her hair in disarray.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Morning, sleepyhead," I teased. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen yawned, "Morning..." before shuffling to the washroom. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After some time, we both finished preparing for the day. At the counter, the innkeeper greeted us with a smile as I settled the bill. "Hope you both slept well!" he said. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I smiled back and replied, "The bed was perfect! Thanks so much!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen, nibbling on an apple, rolled her eyes and muttered, "It was fine..." The innkeeper chuckled, and we went on our way. Stepping outside, Gwen eyed the sword in my hand. "When did you get a sword, Bushy?" she asked. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I paused, confused, then quickly remembered. "Oh, right! Bluma left it with us last night, and I figured we should return it," I explained. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen examined the black metal and commented, "She must be pretty skilled to carry this. If it meant that much to her, she wouldn’t have left it behind."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I glanced at Gwen and said, "Hey! It was probably just an accident. Let’s just get it back to her, alright?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen sighed but agreed, "Fine. But do you even know where she is?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">That’s when I realized my mistake. "Um... no, but we can ask someone!" I </span><span class="c3">suggested scanning</span><span class="c0"> the area.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I spotted a knight nearby and politely asked, "Excuse me, do you know where we might find the Demon Knight?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The knight turned, his hand resting on his sword cautiously. "Why do you ask?" he questioned. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Offering a warm smile, I began explaining, "She accidentally left one of her swords with us, so..." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The knight raised his hand, cutting me off. "You’re her friends? In that case, you’ll find her at the Barracks near the castle gate. Her shift starts soon."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Grateful, I thanked him and led Gwen toward the Barracks. Once inside, we navigated through a sea of knights preparing for the day. After a short search, we found a door with both Bluma and Beans’ names etched into it. "Looks like we found them!" I said with relief. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beans opened the door, his expression one of mild surprise. "Hey, you two. Something up?" he asked. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I held up Bluma's sword with a grin. "She left this with us last night, and..." Before I could finish, Bean grabbed us by the wrists and quickly ushered us inside, closing the door behind us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Bluma gave you her sword?" he exclaimed, shocked. "What did you say to her?" His sudden concern was strange, but I explained our conversation from the previous night, and his tension eased. He smiled and said, "Oh! That means she accepted. We'd be happy to help you both out!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At that moment, Bluma entered, and her eyes fell on the three of us. She glanced at Beans, who nodded. Without a word, Bluma took her sword, sheathed it, and gestured for us to follow her outside.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bluma led us out of the room with Beans trailing behind. I exchanged a glance with Gwen, who just rolled her eyes. After a short walk, we found ourselves in an open field outside the kingdom walls. I scanned the surroundings, noticing the distant forest and a portal a few miles away.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"We're pretty far from the kingdom..." I observed, looking over at Bluma. "What’s going on?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bluma took a few more steps forward, turning to face us as she drew her sword. Gwen smirked, pulling out her massive greatsword, which seemed impossibly large for its sheath. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I stared in disbelief, "How did that even fit in there?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen shot back, "Questions later!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bean interjected, explaining, "Bluma wants to join you, but first, she needs to test your skills." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen's eyes gleamed with excitement as she responded, "So, it’s a sparring match. Let’s dance." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I sighed, shaking my head as I readied myself. "Why does everything have to end in a fight?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen launched the first attack, swinging her sword at Bluma, who deftly blocked it with two blades that appeared from thin air. I attempted to disarm her, but Bluma swiftly evaded by leaping backward. Gwen wasted no time charging again, determination in her eyes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Hold still!" Gwen yelled. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bluma parried, but her armor wasn’t enough to withstand Gwen’s relentless strikes. The greatsword cut through a small section of Bluma’s armor, causing her to grimace as it bit into her arm. Beans, watching from the sidelines, took a step back as Gwen's strike landed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Uh oh..." Bean whispered as Bluma’s eyes began to glow faintly. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In an instant, she flung her sword aside and unleashed a rapid flurry of blows with her dual blades, hitting Gwen multiple times in quick succession. I rushed in to intervene, swinging my staff toward Bluma, but she ducked and dodged my attack effortlessly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Bad move," Gwen muttered as she steadied herself. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Raising her sword, she landed another hit on Bluma’s back, slicing through her armor once more. Bluma retaliated, striking Gwen’s knee, causing her to fall to the ground. Realizing she was outmatched, Gwen sat back, breathing heavily.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bluma turned her attention to me. I took a deep breath, feeling my anger swell at seeing Gwen hurt. Roots and vines erupted from the ground at my command, attempting to snare Bluma. However, she broke free, her strength too much for the plants to hold. The brief distraction allowed me to close the gap between us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I exhaled a cloud of green poisonous mist, blurring Bluma’s vision and disrupting her balance. Seizing the moment, I lunged with my dagger, but Bluma quickly grabbed my arm and tossed me to the ground. Before I could react, I felt the cold edge of her sword against my neck—a clear sign of defeat. Bluma sheathed her sword and collapsed, overcome by the effects of the poison. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Bluma!" Beans cried out, rushing to her side. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mustering my strength, I sat up and crawled over to her. Extending my glowing hand, I began to heal her wounds.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beans looked on in amazement. "How... how are you doing that?" he asked, tears forming in his eyes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I smiled, my hand still hovering over Bluma’s arm as the last of her wounds began to close. "It’s a trick I learned from my Vomete when I was younger." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bluma looked at her arm in awe before pulling Beans into a one-armed hug. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I went to help Gwen, but she pulled away, her eyes wide with a mix of panic and desperation. "Gwen, seriously! Let me help," I said, reaching out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She scooted further away, shaking her head fiercely. “No,” she whispered, her voice tight. Her chest was rising and falling faster than normal, her hands trembling. My patience was thinning, and the last remnants of my energy were slipping away. I summoned vines, their roots snaking across the ground to hold her in place.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Hey! That’s cheating!" Gwen gasped, her voice cracking as she thrashed against the constricting vines.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I wasn’t going to let her wiggle out of this "Stop moving!" I growled, stretching my hand to heal her arm. But no matter how much I reached, she kept shifting, her body stiff with a tension as if she was trying to flee, almost as if there was fear in her movements.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Just hold still!” I shouted, frustration making my voice sharp. Gripping her arm, I pressed my palm against the injury, but the touch sent a visible shudder through her. Her breath caught, and I could feel her body trembling beneath my hand, like she was resisting every inch of contact.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It felt like her entire body was bracing against an old, instinctive fear, one that she couldn’t outrun. But the wound was healing, slow and steady, despite her protests.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The second I let go, Gwen’s fist collided with my chest. The force of the punch knocked me backward, and her words hit harder than anything else. “I told you not to touch me!” she yelled, her voice raw with something I couldn’t quite place. She turned her back on me, her shoulders stiff, her posture taut as if she was waiting for the next blow, real or imagined. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I stayed silent, too exhausted to defend myself. When she glanced over her shoulder, I was already crumpled on the ground, my energy completely drained. The world dimmed as Gwen’s voice, soft but filled with an unspoken weight, called my name from far away. “Don’t—” I couldn't respond. Everything faded to black.</span><hr/></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><h5 class="c7 c23" id="h.2s8eyo1"><span class="c21">CHAPTER 8</span><span class="c13 c8">                                                                                                                     Surface Secrets </span></h5><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">When I awoke, I could not recall the end of our fight with Bluma, and was lying in a strange room—quiet, unfamiliar, and just roomy enough for two. A window let in the amber light of sunset, and a small bookcase stood off to the side, filled with little of interest. As I sat up, I noticed something more pressing: my belongings were gone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">There hadn’t been much in the room to begin with. "Where could they be?" I muttered, eyes sweeping the space. After a moment, I spotted them—bundled neatly and set off to the side, as if someone had taken care to keep them together. "How odd…" I knelt beside the bundle, untying it carefully. One by one, I returned each item to its place—clothes, tools, notes—everything accounted for. Once I was fully packed, a quiet sense of readiness settled over me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I stepped out into a long stone hallway, the walls cool and uneven beneath the glow of wall-mounted torches. A distant noise—something like laughter—echoed faintly in the air. “They’re louder than I’m used to,” I muttered under my breath, trying not to flinch at the echoes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As I walked down the hallway, it led me to a balcony that overlooked a bustling dining hall. There, I spotted Bluma, Beans, and Gwen seated at a table, enjoying their meal.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Hey guys!" I called, raising a hand. They turned toward me—Beans beamed, Gwen looked away. I smiled and added, “I’ll be right down!”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">My eyes landed on a narrow staircase to my left. I moved toward it, voice lifting, “After this, we need to let the king know we’re ready—”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">But as I turned the corner at the bottom of the stairs, I stopped short. The king was standing right there, facing me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">He wore a broad smile and laughed warmly. "Glad to hear it, Deta!" he said with enthusiasm. "Your comrades have shared their stories with me and told me they're now part of your team, ready to face the monster below! It's wonderful to confirm it directly!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The King patted my back and led me to the table. My mind wandered to what my companions might have shared in my absence. Sitting next to Bluma, I noticed Beans and Gwen were across from us. Beans looked relieved, grinning like nothing had gone wrong. Gwen didn’t meet my eyes. I wasn’t sure why—something was off—but I figured I’d ask her about it later.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The King studied me for a moment, expression unreadable. “Perhaps you're unaware, Deta, but tomorrow marks the grand festival of Liberty! It's a joyous occasion, and I'd like to extend a personal invitation for the four of you to be my special guests!" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Bluma and Beans exchanged uncertain glances</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The King quickly picked up on it. "Bluma, as the Queen's trusted knight, I know your duty and that of your squire. However, this time, I'd be delighted if you joined us not as a knight, but as yourself.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Bluma nodded, and Beans couldn't hold back his excitement. "Thank you so much, your highness! This is going to be so exciting!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Gwen, however, remained quiet, arms crossed and gaze fixed on the floor, though her jaw was tight—like she was biting back words. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Grateful, I said, "Thank you, sire!" The King chuckled softly. "Of course! Now, enjoy your day and prepare for the festivities!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans and Bluma were the first to leave, with Beans dashing off and Bluma chasing after him. Gwen stood and left the room quietly. Concerned, I quickly got up and called after her, waving my hand in hopes of getting her attention.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Gwen, wait up!"</span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16 c6">King’s View</span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As they left, my wife appeared around the corner, expressing her concern, "Darling, are you sure it's wise to invite strangers to this event? For all we know, he could still be a spy from the kingdom of Mt. Tarifa..." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I gave a small smile and held her close, reassuring her, "It’s fine, my dear. The kingdom of Mt. Tarifa won’t be a threat to us. I’ll make sure of it." I cupped my wife's face and kissed her, saying, "I love you, my Sundrop."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">My love then smiled and replied, "I love you too my Moonbeam."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Just then, a knight entered to inform me that my presence was needed in the courtroom. With a sigh, I bid my dear a temporary farewell. “I shall see you tonight my love, tell Maggie I will tuck her in tonight” </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">My wife grinned, a spark of mischief in her eyes. “I’ll let Margret know…” she said, her voice just a shade too cheerful.</span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16 c6">Deta’s View</span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Gwen!" I called out, grabbing her shoulder to stop her. By then, we had reached the main plaza. "What's going on...? You're acting… weird." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">She shrugged my hand off and resumed walking, saying, "I'll be fine, Deta. Just leave it." With a quick wave, she disappeared into the crowd. I stood there, feeling unsure of what to do next. Not wanting to be in anyone's way, I decided to take a walk. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Lost in thought, I soon found myself outside the city walls, strolling along a wooden picket fence. I let out a deep sigh, wondering, "Did I do something wrong?" I absent-mindedly let my hand trail above the fence as I walked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Maybe she's just having a rough day," I mused. That’s when I noticed a Dwarf in a nearby field, his black beard bushy and full. He was tilling the soil, probably preparing the seeds for planting. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I called out to him, "Hey there! Need some help?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The Dwarf looked up with a grin and replied. “That would be a big help! Hop over the fence, and I’ll grab you a garden hoe." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I followed his instruction and eyed the fence warily—it creaked under my weight as I vaulted over, but held. I landed with a heavy thud and walked toward where he was working, trying not to leave deep footprints in the soil.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"So, what’s your name, kid?" he asked with a hearty laugh.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I chuckled and answered, "You can call me Deta." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The Dwarf raised an eyebrow, intrigued. "Deta? Are your parents ‘Detations’?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I shook my head. "Not that I know of. What’s a Detation?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The Dwarf chuckled and explained, "Oh, it's a popular religion. I’m not religious myself, but they're good folk. There are quite a few of them around here, but they’re some of the finest people you’ll meet—always willing to lend a hand."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I smiled, pleased. "That’s nice to hear! Oh, I didn’t catch your name!" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The Dwarf laughed again, "Right, call me, Veir!" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">We kept talking as we made our way across the field toward his barn, which sat a good hundred paces off, its roof half-swallowed by ivy. Our conversation drifted from tools to weather to the last time someone got kicked by a mule—Veir had a knack for spinning simple stories into something worth laughing at. Inside the barn, he handed me a spare hoe from the corner. We’d just stepped back into the sunlight when a sharp female voice called out from behind us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"> "Now where do you think you’re going?" they said in an expectant tone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Veir turned around quickly and exclaimed, "Ah, my dearest! This young man has kindly offered to help me in the field!" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I turned to see a female Dwarf with blonde hair tied in a messy bun. She wore a plain dress and a brown apron, both showing signs of wear. She looked at me and asked, “What’s your name, dear?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I smiled and replied, "Oh, I’m Deta, ma’am!" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">She returned my smile and said, "That’s a sweet name. Thank you for helping my husband. I’ll bring out something for both of you to drink soon. Now, off to work, you two!" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Her kindness warmed my heart, and Veir chuckled, "You heard her!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">On our way back to the field, Veir proudly mentioned, "My family’s owned this land for generations, long before the kingdom was even founded, back before the Frost era!" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Intrigued, I asked, "What’s the Frost era?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Veir almost tripped when he heard my question. "Your parents never taught you? What were you raised in a forest or something?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I laughed and replied, "Actually, yes, to both." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">He shook his head, then looked at me with curiosity. "So, what species are you, anyway?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I waved my hand and said, "</span><span class="c3">I'm a Randeth</span><span class="c0">!" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Veir looked at me, astonished. "A Randeth!? Seriously?" He threw his hoe in surprise. "Then why did you make us fetch these tools? Use your magic, boy!" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I chuckled and sat down on the ground. “That's a strange response…” I wondered aloud. “Aren't Randeths supposed to be a myth to people?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Placing my hands in the dirt, I began to converse with the earth in my native tongue. "Flu </span><span class="c3">shetiiuyuta</span><span class="c3"> </span><span class="c3">bogofluuta</span><span class="c3"> tii</span><span class="c3">shuti</span><span class="c3">, </span><span class="c3">tiflusitmas</span><span class="c3">: Flu </span><span class="c3">mivomamashuti</span><span class="c3"> </span><span class="c3">bogorg</span><span class="c0"> cn masgansitme shuti shetemivomate finapamasflutiite."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As the words left my lips, the soil beneath us began to stir. At first, it was subtle—a faint tremor. Then, the earth shifted, its color deepening from a light brown to a rich, dark shade. I watched as the once hard-packed ground softened, becoming looser with each passing moment. Veir’s eyes lit up with excitement, and he crouched down, running his fingers through the now pliable soil. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">A wide smile spread across his face, his joy unmistakable as the earth yielded to my</span><span class="c3"> touch</span><span class="c0">.  "Impressive! But what did you say? Was that Randeth speech?" He tilted his head, one brow raised, waiting for my answer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I chuckled and nodded, "Yes! That was my native language! But all I did was make the dirt healthier."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Veir nodded in understanding. "Oh, right! Randeths have the ability to command the earth and make it more fertile for life to grow!" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I was genuinely surprised by how much he knew about my abilities. "If you don't mind me asking, how do you know so much about </span><span class="c3">Randeths</span><span class="c0">? Most people think we're fictional, let alone know about our magic."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Veir laughed heartily and replied, "Oh, my boy, you're not the first Randeth I've encountered! Although it was many years ago, it didn't immediately click with me!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My excitement grew. "May I ask if the Randeth you met was named Vomete?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Veir took a moment to think and responded, "Erm... I'm not quite sure. As I said, it has been a few hundred years, so the details are a bit hazy." He shrugged, uncertain of any further information. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nonetheless, I was glad to have found someone who knew Randeths were real. "Well, should we put these tools away?" I suggested picking up my hoe and getting up from the ground.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"That sounds like a good idea, lad. No need for them to get rusty! They get a nice vacation this season" Veir chuckled, and together we went to put the tools away. Once we had finished, he invited me inside to sit and relax for a while. I gladly accepted, hoping to make it back to town before nightfall.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As we entered, his wife peered around the corner. "Is everything all right, dearest? You're already inside…" she then took on a more stern tone “Did you hurt yourself?” </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Veir chuckled and reassured her, "I'm fine, love. Our new friend here fixed our field in a matter of seconds!" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She was visibly surprised and skeptically remarked, "Really..." She stopped what she was doing in the room and walked toward us, casting her eyes upon the revitalized field.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Oh my! You really did it!” She turned to me and added with a chuckle, “If I had a daughter, I’d ask you to marry her!”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I froze, my joints locking for a moment. “What!?” I said sharply, voice catching just slightly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Veir laughed heartily at my reaction. “Indeed! That way, we could keep you around!” He and his wife shared a laugh, but I couldn’t shake my discomfort. Veir heartily patted my back and said, “We were just joking. Please, come in and have a seat. We’d love to get to know you! It’s not every day we get a Randeth visitor.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I chuckled, appreciating their warm hospitality, and agreed to join them. I settled into a chair in the room, taking in the sights of their lovely home adorned with family pictures and various mementos. One particular photo caught my attention as I noticed two familiar faces. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Veir and his wife entered the room a few moments later, carrying a mug of alcohol for me. I accepted it graciously but couldn't help but wonder, do all creatures drink this all the time? We chatted casually for a while, until a framed photo on the mantel caught my eye.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Who's that?" I asked, nodding toward it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Veir’s wife perked up immediately. “Oh, that was taken years ago—hang on, I’ll go get it.” She stood, almost too quickly, clearly eager to relive whatever memory the picture held.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">"This picture was drawn seven years ago when our son, </span><span class="c3">Beans, brought his mentor to meet us</span><span class="c0">,” she said, her voice brimming with warmth and pride. “He was absolutely thrilled to introduce her to us!” </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I thought I recognized the faces in the picture, and excitement filled me. "Beans is your son? I know him! He and the Demon Knight are joining me and my friend on a quest for the King!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Bean</span><span class="c0">s’ mother grew incredibly excited upon hearing that I knew her son. She proceeded to share numerous things she wanted me to relay to him, and shared many, many stories… The rhythm of our work carried us through the day—talking, pausing, laughing now and then—until the sky dimmed and shadows stretched long across the fields.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I gazed out the window and muttered, "Oh, geez..." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Veir looked at me curiously and asked, "Is something wrong, boy?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I let out a sigh and replied, "Well, the King is hosting a party tomorrow, and I got to return to town soon."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Veir's</span><span class="c3"> wife chimed in, "Oh! Will Beans be accompanying you?" I nodded in affirmation, prompting her to snap her fingers and exclaim, "Alright! He dropped off his suit earlier today. Would you mind taking it to him? I can also </span><span class="c3">whip up one</span><span class="c0"> for you!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I smiled gratefully and said, "Oh, I must have just barely missed him. Thank you for the offer, but you don't have to-" Just then a rock shattered through the window. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Veir stood up, exclaiming, "Not again! These darn Basilisk-folk show up every night and steal our crops!" He turned to me and pleaded, "Could you turn them into some kind of animals or something?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I felt a twinge of hesitation as that was… impossible. "I could try to </span><span class="c3">help,</span><span class="c0">" I replied tentatively.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Veir nodded eagerly and said, "Great! Let's go!" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The two of us rushed out the door, only to be greeted by five lizard-like creatures as tall as Gwen wreaking havoc in the fields. These creatures had long tails, fins running from the back of their heads all the way down their spines, and large feet. Their arms were of medium length, and their eyes gleamed with a menacing red hue.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Veir turned to me, his voice urgent. "Can you do something?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I gazed at the lizard people, observing the destruction they were causing, and suddenly felt a surge of confidence. Something clicked inside me, and without hesitation, I charged toward the nearest creature.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As I sprinted toward the beast, my instincts took over, and I transformed into a mighty elk, the symbol of the Randeths. The Basilisk-folk turned to face me, but before they could react, my antlers pierced through their scales, sending one of them flying through the air and impaling it on a fence post.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This dramatic turn of events caught the attention of the remaining creatures, scattering them. They retaliated by hurling rocks from their slings in my direction. Some struck me, but undeterred, I charged toward the next closest Basilisk. It dodged my attack, while the other three beings converged on me, brandishing their slings, and the one I missed drew a dagger and lunged at me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Seizing the moment, I reared up on my hind legs, causing one of the Basilisk-folk to miss its strike and fall beneath my hooves. With nimble movements, I darted past the other creatures, but a fence at the corner of the field blocked my way. This gave them enough time to close in, and they started throwing daggers.Each blow from their blades chipped away at me, until my transformed form shattered, forcing me back into my humanoid body. The world spun—I still felt hooves where my hands should be. Instinct took over, and I lunged forward like a beast, only to catch my own foot and crash hard, face-first into the dirt.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">By the time I scrambled upright, they were already mid-leap—fangs bared, eyes wild.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I threw out my hand without thinking, and the earth answered. Thick roots erupted from the ground, snaking and thrashing like wild serpents. They coiled around limbs, yanked bodies mid-air—but in my panic, I overreached. The vines caught my legs too, locking me in place just as the nearest Basilisk landed with a hiss inches from my face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Both the Basilisk and I struggled to break free from the entanglement, but our efforts were useless. Two of the Basilisk-Folk threw daggers that grazed my arm. Clutching my arm, I tore myself free from the roots, determined to finish with the remaining creatures.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Approaching one of the Basilisk-folk, I extended my hand, releasing a cloud of gas. The creature inhaled the gas, writhing in discomfort before succumbing. With two foes left, one tried to flee, while the other hurled another dagger at my arm.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I advanced on the fleeing creature, repeating the same process. As it realized escape was futile, the last Basilisk-folk pleaded, "Please don't kill me! I beg you!" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Coming to a halt right in front of it, I replied, "If you promise your clan will never set foot here again, I will spare your life." My firm tone conveyed the seriousness of my words. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The creature agreed and vowed to stay far away. I helped it escape the entanglement, and </span><span class="c3">after grabbing its fallen comrades</span><span class="c0">, it bolted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Exhausted from the battle, I collapsed onto the ground, my breath heavy. Veir approached, offering his congratulations and a place to stay for the night. Fatigued and unsteady, I accepted, realizing I wouldn't make it back to town on my own.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The next morning, as the sun timidly crept over the horizon, Veir woke me. "Hey, kid, wake up. You need to get going if you want to reach the kingdom by noon."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Still groggy, I mumbled, "Hm... But Vomete... I haven't photosynthesized yet..." Yawning, I opened my eyes and saw Veir. "Oh! Uh, sorry, Veir."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He chuckled. "No problem, but if you want to make it back to the kingdom, you need to set off now. Come downstairs and grab something to eat before you leave."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With that, he left the room,which, from the looks of the knight decor—polished suits of armor standing sentinel in the corners, faded banners stitched with old heraldry, and iron sconces shaped like crossed swords—seemed intended to impress, happened to be Beans’ old room. Letting out a sigh, I got up. Waking up before sunrise wasn't my usual routine, since I relied on sunlight for energy, but I had enough reserves to last a few days. However, after the intense fight, I felt completely drained.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Heading downstairs, I found Bean's mom waiting for me. "Hello, darling. Thank you so much for your help last night! Those stupid lizards have been causing us so much trouble." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I let out a soft chuckle, still drowsy. "No problem..." I yawned again. She handed me a satchel. "In here, you'll find some clothes that should fit both you and Beans. As well as some bread. Take good care of my son now, alright?" She smiled warmly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I nodded and made my way outside.After a few hours of walking, I reached the city gates. Upon entering, I was greeted by a bustling town transformed for the celebration of Liberty Day. Children darted between stalls with ribbons in their hair and sticky sweets in their hands, their laughter ringing through the air. Adults clustered in groups, drinking, dancing, or clapping along to the music played by passing bands. The streets were draped in colorful banners. A smile crept across my face as I took in the heartwarming scene. Suddenly, I heard a familiar voice beside me. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"There you are, Deta! How are you?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I turned to see Beans, dressed in a tunic and tan pants, with Bluma in more relaxed attire. I greeted them, "Hey, guys! Funny enough, Beans, I was just at your parents' place."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beans stepped back, surprised. "What!? Why were you there?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bluma patted his head as I quickly explained, "I was wandering in and ended up helping in the field. Then some lizard people attacked, but everything's fine now! We fought them off!" I tried to rush through the explanation to prevent worry, but it had the opposite effect. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Beans exclaimed, "Basilisk-folk!? </span><span class="c3">Are my parents okay? Why didn't they tell me?</span><span class="c0">"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Chuckling, I reassured him, "I'm not sure but, your parents are perfectly fine. There were about five or so of them." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beans breathed a sigh of relief. "Oh, good... I'm glad they're okay. But five of them? Really? One is easy to take down, but as a pack, they're a challenge."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bluma then spoke up, noticing Gwen was not with me. "Gwen?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I sighed and replied, "Last time I talked with her she seemed to need some time alone. I'm sure she's alright." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bluma nodded, then noticed the satchel I was holding. Once she pointed to it I then remembered why I had it. "Oh! Yes, Beans, your mom wanted me to give you something."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beans stopped me just as I reached into the bag.<br/> “Oh, really? Heh, awesome! Come with me. Bluma! I’ll be right back!” He said with a giant grin.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before I could see Bluma’s response, He practically bounced ahead, leading me down the street and up the stairs of a nearby inn. As we reached a small room at the end of the hall, he grinned.<br/> “The suit’s already done?” he laughed. “That’s my Mama for you—she works fast!”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Pulling it out, the shirt was a long white tunic with a simple, thin black sweater and pants. Beans beamed with excitement. "Thanks for bringing this!</span><span class="c3"> I can't wait to surprise Bluma!</span><span class="c0">"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">He shoved the suit into his satchel, and we headed out of the inn. I left mine in its bag—Once we got back, Bluma and Beans practically shoved me toward the festival.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">During my walk, I noticed several stands set up in the Central Plaza, so I wandered over. In one stand, a pool of little fish was the main attraction, with kids trying to catch them. Depending on the size of the fish they caught, they could win more as prizes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Although it looked fun, I noticed there was a fee to participate, and having no money, I simply observed. That’s when I saw a child nearby, their small fists clenched at their sides, lower lip trembling. Their eyes, wide and glassy, flicked back and forth between the game and the few coins in their palm, as if willing more to appear. Frustration clung to their face like static, and they teetered on the edge of tears, shoulders rising with every shallow breath. Something about their silent struggle tugged at me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I whispered to the fish, “Hey, over here.” They turned toward me. Pointing to the child, I sent my message, and the largest fish handed itself over, leaping straight into the child’s bag.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The child’s face lit up, and they jumped for joy. The parents were ecstatic, and the family walked away brimming with happiness. Watching this, the other kids became eager to catch their own fish. Just as I was about to leave, the man running the stand approached. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Hey, I saw what you did there, kid,” he said with a gruff tone of voice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Startled, I quickly apologized. “Oh, I didn’t mean any harm!” </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The man chuckled, shaking his head. “Relax. I was going to help the kid anyway, but you saved me the trouble. Thanks" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I smiled, thankful I </span><span class="c3">didn't</span><span class="c3"> upset him somehow “Oh no worries!” I said before </span><span class="c3">leaving</span><span class="c0"> to explore more.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As the day wore on, more games and activities were set up. Toward sunset, three knights entered the plaza. Two of them blew their horns, grabbing the crowd’s attention while the third stepped forward, announcing: </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“In honor of Liberty Day, King Aldric and Queen Elara are hosting a grand ballroom party at the palace! All are invited!”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Cheers erupted from the crowd, and people either began preparing their stalls or rushed home to get ready. The knights spotted me and approached. One of them asked, “Are you Deta?” </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I nodded, and the knight bowed with respect as the one in the center spoke. “The king has requested we escort you to the ballroom. Will you come with us?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Trying not to chuckle at the bow, I agreed, and the knights led me to the castle. As I entered the grand ballroom, the sight took me in. Banquet tables stretched along the walls, covered in crisp white cloths, each set with polished silverware and modest centerpieces of roses and lilies. The marble floor gleamed softly, catching the gentle light from chandeliers that hung high above, casting a warm glow. Every corner was adorned with subtle flower arrangements and soft lighting, creating an air of understated elegance throughout the room.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"> “Wow, they really went all out,” I muttered in awe.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As I wandered inside, I saw Gwens face on the opposite side of the room, just entering. “Oh, Gwen!” I called out, walking over and stepping in front of her with a smile. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Once I got over, my eyes were drawn to her dress—a rich blue that caught the light in subtle, flattering ways, complementing her every movement. The fabric fit her figure perfectly before flowing into a soft, full dress that draped naturally to the floor. Around the neckline, feathers in varying shades of blue added a touch of depth and texture, gently swaying with each step she took. The feathers brought a playful element to her otherwise elegant look, highlighting her effortless grace and charm, a blend that q</span><span class="c3">uietly invited admiration</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Well?” Gwen snapped, arms crossed. “Are you going to say something, or should I just walk through you?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Chuckling, I stepped back a few paces, allowing her through. She rolled her eyes and walked on. “It looks good on you, Gwen,” I called after her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"> She paused slightly, her head tilting just enough to acknowledge the comment. After a brief silence, she muttered, “...thanks,” before continuing on.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I entered a smaller room just off from the main to change into the suit that Beans’ mother had made for me. It was similar to Beans’ outfit, consisting of a thin black jacket and trousers made from fine wool, paired with a crisp white shirt. The suit felt slightly loose at first, but once I layered it over my clothes, it fit perfectly. Smiling to myself, I admired the transformation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As I was about to leave the room a small fire lily plant near the window caught my eye. Its slender stems reached upward, crowned with vibrant red blooms that resembled tiny flames. The plant’s magical properties radiated warmth and comfort. I approached and gently touched it, causing it to sprout and spread its soothing warmth through the room. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I slipped out of the room and made my way back to the ballroom. The King stood off the main platform, chatting with Beans and Bluma near the food tables—not far from the throne, but not exactly royal about it either.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr/><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><h5 class="c7 c23" id="h.17dp8vu"><span class="c21">CHAPTER 9 </span><span class="c13 c8">                                                                                                                               The Beginning to an End</span></h5><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As the evening progressed, the four of us found ourselves scattered throughout the lively ballroom. Bluma and Beans were chatting with other knights while enjoying the music. Gwen, on the other hand, seemed to have vanished from sight, though I had glimpsed her discreetly gathering berries from the banquet table and stashing them in a small leather pouch. As for me, I stood awkwardly to the side, uncertain of how to fully engage in the festivities.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The music came to a halt, and a clear voice rang out across the hall, announcing that it was time for a break—to enjoy the spread and mingle. Almost at once, the crowd stirred with fresh energy, drifting toward the long banquet tables set beneath hanging lanterns and soft golden drapery.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The tables were lavish, almost sagging beneath the sheer weight of the feast. Glazed meats shimmered under the lights—whole roasted pheasants with crisp, crackling skin pulled tight over tender flesh, and thick ribs lacquered in a dark, sticky glaze that clung to the bone. There were carved fruits shaped into elaborate flowers—some familiar, others strange and jewel-toned, with flesh like pale blue honey or deep crimson velvet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">There were soft, steaming breads dusted with fragrant herbs, their crusts flaking at the lightest touch, and cheeses stacked like miniature towers, ranging from creamy and pale to waxy blocks the color of burnished gold. Dishes of bright pickled vegetables glistened like gems, and small, delicate pastries sat arranged in perfect rows, their sugary shells cracking open to reveal molten fruit or spiced cream.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I couldn’t smell any of it—not the slow-roasted meats or the tang of citrus in the sorbets melting into their dishes. But I could see how the others reacted—eyes widening, lips parting as they breathed in the aroma-laced air. One woman near me even closed her eyes and smiled as she lifted a slice of something red and glistening to her mouth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I didn’t eat, but I watched.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The pheasant looked tender, its skin golden and crackling with roasted herbs. A thin sheen of glaze caught the light, glistening faintly amber. Pastries broke apart in buttery flakes, steam curling from their centers as warm apple and spice spilled out. Sorbets shimmered in delicate glass bowls, already starting to melt into swirls of color.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">People murmured to each other between bites—praising this sauce, that marinade—while others traded gossip between sips of wine. The room had taken on a new kind of music: the clink of cutlery, the hush of velvet sleeves brushing past, the low murmur of voices punctuated by laughter and soft, satisfied sighs.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans and Bluma approached me then, their faces flushed like roses. I couldn’t help but chuckle at the sight of them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Are you two okay?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans giggled and responded enthusiastically, "I'm great!" He hiccupped and then turned to Bluma, saying, "I'll be right back!" He swayed slightly as he walked over to the food, for a moment it reminded me of rose when we were in the tavern.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I laughed, amused by his cheerful demeanor, but more to mask the sorrow from the memory of failing her and her sisters, then I turned my attention to Bluma, who also seemed flushed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Curiously, I asked her, "And what about you? Have you had a drink as well?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Bluma shook her head, denying any involvement with alcohol, and said, "No." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Her response sparked my curiosity, and I wondered what had caused her rosy complexion. I made my way over to them, figuring I might as well enjoy the feast and see who else was worth talking to.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Continuing my exploration of the festivities, I noticed the absence of the Queen and the Princess as I reached the front of the room. Only the King could be found seated on his throne, and when he caught sight of me, he beckoned me over. I approached him, curious about his summons.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The King let out a sigh before speaking. "Deta, could you please check on my wife and child? Your friend also accompanied them to the balcony." Concern filled his voice as he expressed his worry. “I mean no disrespect but I do worry about my Queen”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I nodded in response, assuring him. "Of course. I will go and check on them right away."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">With gratitude in his eyes, the King thanked me, and I began my search, navigating through the labyrinthine corridors of the castle in an effort to locate the specific balcony in question.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16 c8 c6 c14">Gwens’ View</span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c5 c8 c6 c14"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The Queen’s voice cut through the silence like a blade. “You’re not much of a fan of parties, are you?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">I didn’t bother to look at her. Just kept flicking fire berries into my mouth and breathing out soft bursts of flame. The sky was clearer than I expected—</span><span class="c5">uncluttered</span><span class="c2">. Peaceful. A stark contrast to the palace.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I groaned. “Not really. I’d rather be out doing something useful. Or at least something fun.” I hesitated, thumb brushing the edge of the pouch. “I spent too long being trapped by other people’s expectations. I’m not about to throw myself into another cage.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">She hummed, and I could hear the practiced smile in it. Polished, polite, but with something sharper just beneath.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Before she could say more, the door slammed open behind us, </span><span class="c5">bouncing off the wall</span><span class="c2">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Look, Mommy! I found it!”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">I turned just in time to see the Princess rush in, </span><span class="c5">a stuffed</span><span class="c2"> bear clutched in her arms like a prize. Her curls were bouncing wildly, eyes bright. If she’d brought that thing in here, there’s no way she’d been with the Queen the whole time. Probably wandered off again. And no one stopped her?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The Queen gave a soft laugh that didn't quite reach her eyes. “I’m so proud of you, my dear. Now, back to your father.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">The girl beamed and ran off, </span><span class="c5">the door</span><span class="c2"> swinging halfway shut behind her. I watched it for a moment, waiting for someone to close it. No one did.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The Queen finally stepped closer, leaning beside me against the railing. She didn’t even glance at the stars.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Tell me,” she said, her voice syrupy sweet “Why do you feel the need to go gallivanting across the world? Why not stay, settle down, start a family?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I snorted, shaking my head. “Good one. I’ve had enough people getting in my way—or worse, getting hurt because of me. I’m fine on my own.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">She laughed lightly, like I’d said something charming. I didn’t like it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Then she held out a hand, palm up. “May I?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I hesitated, then slapped a berry into her hand. Her fingers curled around it like she was holding something fragile... or filthy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">“You could always join my </span><span class="c5">Knights</span><span class="c2">,” the Queen said, like she was offering me a glass of wine instead of a life sentence. “You’re strong. That hit you landed was impressive.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I blinked at her, slowly. “What hit?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“The Randeth, of course.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">My spine stiffened. </span><span class="c5 c8 c6 c14">Of course.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">I almost laughed—</span><span class="c5 c6">almost.</span><span class="c2"> My fingers curled tight around the berry pouch.  So that’s what she thought this was. A job interview. A recruitment pitch.  Like knocking Deta down made me some kind of hero. Like hurting him was the goal.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I forced a smirk, sharp as broken glass. “Didn’t realize you were scouting during a crisis.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">She smiled back, calm as ever. Like she hadn't just insulted someone I actually gave a crap about. Like she didn’t see him as anything more than a </span><span class="c5 c8 c6 c14">thing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">And maybe she didn’t.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“I mean, not everyone can handle creatures like that,” the Queen said, turning the berry over like it was already rotting in her hand. “They’re unpredictable. Wild. Dangerous. Better off with someone to keep them in check.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">My jaw locked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c6">He saved you,</span><span class="c5"> I reminded myself. </span><span class="c5 c6">That’s all. You owe him. That’s it. </span><span class="c2">This wasn’t about caring. I didn’t care. That was stupid.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">She crushed the berry—slow, deliberate. Juice dripped down her fingers, dark red against her pale skin..</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Her eyes stayed on mine, daring me to flinch instead.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“But I suppose,” she said, soft and sharp, “that’s why we need people like you, hmm? To keep them from getting out of hand.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">I didn’t look away. I </span><span class="c5 c6">wouldn’t</span><span class="c5">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">That’s all it was.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">I wasn’t angry because she called him dangerous. I was angry because she said it like </span><span class="c5">he wasn’t a person at all</span><span class="c2">.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16 c8 c6 c14">Deta’s View</span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c5 c8 c6 c14"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I wandered through the quiet halls, the sounds of the ballroom muffled behind thick stone walls. The whole place felt too grand, too imposing. I didn’t belong here, and it was starting to weigh on me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As I rounded a corner, the door to a side room swung open, and Maggie practically launched herself at me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Deta!” </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">She wrapped her arms around my legs in a tight hug, grinning up at me with that same innocent brightness. I froze, unsure how to react. I didn’t have skin—couldn’t really feel it—but there was something about her warmth, her trust, that made me feel... something.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“I’m glad you’re here!” she said with a giggle. “Mama didn’t like you at first, but I told her you were nice.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">I awkwardly patted her head, my stone fingers </span><span class="c5">clicking</span><span class="c2"> against her hair. “I... appreciate that.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">She pulled away to look up at me with wide eyes. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">“Where’s the Queen? And </span><span class="c5">Gwen</span><span class="c5">?”</span><span class="c5"> </span><span class="c5">I hesitated, the mention of the Queen making something in my chest tighten. But Maggie was looking at me expectantly, so I gave her a small smile.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“They’re in there, Mama’s talking to a lady.” She pointed to the door nearby. “You can go see now!”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I nodded and gave her a small wave. “Thanks, Maggie.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">I walked to the door little Maggie told me to go to </span><span class="c5">and </span><span class="c5">heard Gwen and the Queen talking but couldn't make out what they were saying</span><span class="c2">. I then opened the door fully as they turned to see who it was. “Is everything okay?” I asked while looking at Gwen. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The Queen’s smile faltered for a split second before she forced it back. “Oh, we’re quite alright. Thank you, though. I suppose you could say we’re having a... stimulating conversation… Randeth…”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Gwen then stepped away and approached the door with purpose. She gave the Queen a polite nod. “Thank you for the… offer. For now, I have other plans that I need to keep my word to but I’ll think about it.” </span><span class="c5">Gwen then walked past me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I turned to observe the Queen, who directed a deathly glare my way. However, I maintained a smile on my face, unaffected by her animosity. As the Queen closed the door behind us, I took a deep breath and proceeded to catch up with Gwen, who seemed deep in thought. I glanced over, brow furrowing. “You alright?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Gwen let out a sigh, one of those weary ones that tried too hard to sound like nothing. “Yeah. I’m fine,” she said, but her voice had an edge, like something was gnawing at the back of her thoughts.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Before I could press, she reached into her pouch and tossed something into my hand. A handful of small, dark-red berries.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Here. Eat these.”</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c2">I blinked at them. “What are—”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Too late. I popped the whole handful into my mouth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Her eyes went wide. “Wait—oh my </span><span class="c5 c6">tachi’guf</span><span class="c5">! That’s terrible! You ate </span><span class="c5 c6">all</span><span class="c2"> of them!?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I froze mid-chew.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Fire berries,” she said, already laughing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">My eyes shot open as the heat exploded in my mouth—like someone had poured molten metal over my tongue. I choked on a gasp, nearly tripping over myself as the fire spread down my throat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Wh—what the—!” I staggered back, fanning my mouth like it would do anything to help. “Ow—Gwen! Not funny!”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">She was doubled over, howling with laughter, barely managing to breathe between snorts.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">I burped, and a puff of smoke curled out from my lips. “</span><span class="c5 c6">Seriously?!</span><span class="c2">” I coughed, sweat starting to bead along my stone brow. My lips tingled like they’d been stung.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Gwen was already walking away, cackling like a maniac.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I lunged for the nearest drink and downed it in two gulps, the cool liquid easing the worst of the burn. I wiped my mouth, still coughing, and glared after her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">She sauntered back with her own drink, eyes twinkling. I muttered under my breath, “You’re the worst.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Mmhm,” she said, raising her glass. “You’re welcome.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"How do people eat this stuff?" I sighed, saying. "Nice joke, Gwen... Now I have to find a way to get back at you somehow."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">She grinned and replied. "Good luck, Bushy." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Taking another sip, </span><span class="c5">I realized </span><span class="c2">it had the same taste as the alcohol I had before and knew what would happen soon. "Oh boy..."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Just then, a knight made an announcement, "It's the last dance of the night!" While the knight continued speaking, I noticed Gwen had disappeared again. Looking around, I spotted her whispering to the band responsible for playing the music at the party. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Oh goodness gracious... Here we go." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As soon as the knight finished speaking, the band nodded at Gwen and rushed back. The band launched into a faster-paced formal song, much to the crowd's delight. I chuckled, watching Bluma and Beans dancing on the floor. Even the King seemed to be enjoying himself. Standing there, a robed man approached me. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Hello there,” he said. “Aren't you planning to join the festivities? As one of the King's guests, I assume..."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I chuckled and replied, "Well, I'm not much of a party person."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The robed man smiled and suggested, "Ah, I see. Have you tried using alcohol to ease your discomfort?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I sighed. "Doesn’t do anything for me. I’m not exactly built like everyone else."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The man pondered this for a moment. "I have an idea," he said, flicking my head, causing both of us some pain—I felt the impact of the flick, and he winced at hitting solid wood</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"What was that for?" I suddenly felt a warm sensation inside, and the man smiled. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"I've magically made you drunk. It should have more effect as the night goes on. Now, go and have..." His words began to blur and fade, drifting away as if they were floating through water. A strange warmth spread through me, and the world felt just a little softer around the edges.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The next thing I knew, I was lying on a bed. The wooden ceiling above me seemed to spin slightly as I blinked against the sunlight coming through the window. My head felt heavy, like it was wrapped in cotton, and there was a faint ache behind my eyes. Sitting up, I rubbed my face and tried to get my bearings.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Looking around, I saw Gwen asleep in another bed, her arm hanging lazily over the side. </span><span class="c5">Beans was curled up</span><span class="c2"> in a blanket, snoring quietly, while Bluma was already awake, sitting on her bed and putting on her armor with calm precision.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I tried to remember what had happened, but everything felt muddled—just bits of laughter and blurry faces, nothing clear. The room swayed a little as I stood, and I had to steady myself, wondering how much of last night I had missed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Good morning, Bluma," I said, yawning. She turned to me and waved while continuing to don her armor. "That party was interesting... I can hardly remember anything." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Bluma chuckled, and as I glanced outside the window at the town, I sighed, saying, "Today is the day we explore what lies beneath it all, huh?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Bluma finished fastening her armor and nodded. She then walked over, placed her hand on my shoulder, and said, "Courage." Afterward, she went to Beans.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I smiled and replied, "I'll try." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">I glanced at Gwen and blinked. She was wearing one of those strapless dresses—bare shoulders, a lot of skin. I turned away, because I remembered humans get weird about that. Then I frowned. “Wait... but she </span><span class="c5 c6">is</span><span class="c2"> wearing clothes.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5"> Getting up, </span><span class="c5">I poked her</span><span class="c2"> on the face trying to get a response, "Gwen?" She didn't respond, so I paused to think and then got an idea.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"There's a fight waiting for you," I said. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Her eyes widened, and she jumped up, exclaiming, "Where's the fight? I'm in!" </span><span class="c5">After realizing we were still in the inn</span><span class="c2">, she gave me an unamused look, "Oh, very funny..." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Chuckling, I retorted, "Got you back!" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">She glanced down at her dress, rolled her eyes, and commented, "I have to change out of this hideous thing.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Bluma then grabbed my arm, ushering me out of the room. She gently pushed the sleepy Beans out as well and closed the door behind us. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I was quite confused. "Uh... what?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans rubbed his eyes and yawned. “They’re changing. They need privacy.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Oh.” I tilted my head. “So that’s normal? Humans change clothes a lot?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans nodded. “Yeah. Daily, usually. It’s a modest thing.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Huh. Randeths don’t really do that. I mean we own a pair of clothes… We wash it, fix it if it tears. Clothes aren’t for us—they’re to keep lost travelers comfortable.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans blinked. “Right. Okay, maybe... don’t say that part out loud either.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I nodded, understanding the difference in customs. "Things work differently here than in the woods," I said with a smile.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">After a while, Gwen and Bluma emerged from the room, both wearing their armor and swords. Gwen, though, now had a strange device slung across her back—metal and wood, shaped oddly, with string stretched tight.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I pointed. “What’s that on her back?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans looked up. “Oh, that’s a crossbow. Shoots bolts real fast—like a bow, but easier to aim.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I blinked. “That’s a weapon?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Yep. The King had some made for folks like us—non-magic types. Helps even things out.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As the two walked past us, Gwen smiled. “Don’t take too long in there, ladies.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I chuckled at her teasing remark, and then Beans and I changed out of the party wear. I simply took mine off, straightening my normal clothes underneath, while Beans started throwing on his armor. His set was a simpler version of Bluma’s—same red and gold, but more dull. His breastplate had that dark red look, with just a bit of gold trim here and there, nothing too fancy. The pauldrons were smaller, more practical, and the rest—gauntlets and greaves—were tough but plain.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Afterward, we made our way toward the inn’s door, only to halt in surprise at the sight of knights standing just outside. Their armor gleamed in the fading sunlight, the metal catching the last warmth of the day. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"As a token of our gratitude, we have cleared a path to the castle," one of the knights announced, his voice solemn as he bowed slightly. His dark helmet obscured his face, leaving only a hint of shadow where his expression might have been.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Gwen grinned, her eyes flashing with excitement. "V.I.P. treatment. I like this." The words rolled off her tongue with a sense of playful entitlement. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans, standing beside her, chuckled—a deep, hearty sound that broke through the tension. Bluma merely nodded, her usual silence masking any emotion, while I managed a polite smile and voiced my thanks to the knights.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">We stepped forward, the crowd that had gathered on the street parting with murmurs. Concerned gazes followed us as we moved toward the castle. The atmosphere felt heavy, as though the townspeople were watching something they didn’t fully understand. I caught the eye of a young woman with a basket of flowers, her lips pressed tight in worry. Offering her a small smile, I waved at her and a few others, hoping to alleviate the tension, even if just for a moment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The castle loomed ahead, towering and imposing. When we entered, the air turned cooler, a sharp contrast to the warmth outside. Bluma and Beans took the lead as we approached a wide staircase spiraling upward. The stone steps echoed beneath our feet, each step seeming to pull us higher into the gloom. I hated these stairs. The way they coiled upward without end, as though we were climbing a mountain, not simply moving through a building.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Minutes turned to what felt like hours as we ascended for what seemed like an eternity, our breaths becoming heavier with each step. I tried not to let the others see how much I despised this endless climb. Bluma, of course, seemed unaffected, moving with her usual grace. Finally, after what felt like thirty minutes of unrelenting stairs, we reached the top, breathless and aching.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><hr/><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><h5 class="c7 c23" id="h.axqirlaogynt"><span class="c21">CHAPTER </span><span class="c21">10                                                                                                          </span><span class="c13 c8">Delving Deeper</span></h5><p class="c19 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">A heavy wooden door greeted us. Bluma pushed it open, the hinges creaking in protest, revealing a room scorched and blackened by flames. The air smelled faintly of smoke. Rubble lay scattered across the floor, chunks of stone and charred beams strewn like the remnants of a battle. Still, a few items had somehow survived—the outline of a tapestry on one wall, half-burnt furniture huddled in one corner, their shapes barely recognizable.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">We stepped inside, the sound of our boots crunching over the debris echoing in the silence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"What happened here?" I asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans replied, "This is where we fought a traitor to the kingdom, and this was his vengeful act."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">I nodded in pretend understanding</span><span class="c2">, and Gwen smirked, saying, "Nice..."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Bluma walked over to a chest in the room and examined its contents. She handed each of us a rolled-up piece of paper and a gray drink in a glass bottle. "Emergencies," she explained. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans nodded and unrolled the paper to see what it contained. "These are potions of strength and scrolls of slow falling. Keep them with you in case of any unforeseen circumstances."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Gwen looked at the items curiously and asked, "Why would we need these scrolls, anyway?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans glanced at her and replied, "Well, the dungeon is very old and built on top of a cave system. We're unsure about its stability, so it's better to be safe." Bluma nodded in agreement, and Gwen sighed before whispering something in another language.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">We stowed the items in our satchels then proceeded to descend a different set of stairs, which felt damp and chilly. Midway down, Beans spoke up, warning us, "This is the dungeon, where the monster is said to reside. Be cautious, as there are creatures lurking everywhere."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Upon hearing Beans's warning, we became alert and walked on our toes. At the bottom of the stairs, we encountered two doors. Bluma opened one, and we followed her inside. We had now entered the underground.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Passing through the doorway, we found ourselves in a long hallway that appeared to have been excavated. Water dripped from the ceiling, </span><span class="c5">causing Bluma and Gwen's hair to frizz slightly</span><span class="c2">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Bluma took the lead, carefully observing our surroundings. As we walked down the hallway, we noticed rooms branching off from its sides. Beans looked into the farthest room, while I checked the one closest to me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans slowed as he stepped into the small room. “Huh. Dead end,” he muttered, eyeing the cold remains of a long-forgotten campfire. He crouched down and poked at the ashes. “Someone used to be here... but it’s been a while.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">He stood, dusted off his hands, and turned to follow Bluma. “Nothin’ useful. Let’s keep going.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I stepped cautiously into the room, my gaze drawn to the strange mounds on the floor. They looked like they’d been excavated—dirt and debris piled up, then refilled haphazardly, as if someone had dug them up and decided to cover them again. I took a few steps forward, my curiosity piqued by the oddity of the room.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Suddenly, I felt a strong tug at my collar. Before I could react, Gwen yanked me back, causing me to stumble awkwardly. “Hey!” I protested, more surprised than anything. “You don’t have to be so rough…”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Gwen glanced at me, her expression unreadable. She let out an exasperated sigh before releasing my collar with a muttered, “Fine, whatever.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I didn’t understand what had her so on edge, but I didn’t press it. We were all tense, unsure of what we’d find in this place.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Bluma paused at the end of the hallway in front of a door. She studied it for a moment, her hand resting on the handle. With a sharp look, she gave a simple, “Move.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The room beyond was empty—nothing more than bare stone walls and dust. There was another door on the far side of the room, and one more on the left wall. The stillness was unsettling.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Bluma nodded toward the far door. “Go,” she said quietly, her voice sharp but calm.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans scanned the surroundings and noticed dwarven runes etched into some of the stones. He headed toward the door in front of us, prompting Gwen to ask, "Beans, what are you doing?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans paused and looked back, his nerves evident as he wasn’t used to taking the lead in a large group. "Well, I noticed these markings resemble dwarven architecture. I thought it might be safer for us to go this way."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I smiled and said, "Sounds good to me!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I glanced at Gwen and Bluma, who both nodded in agreement, and we followed Beans into the room. As he entered, two large shadowy creatures lunged at him and latched onto his torso. He let out a scream and jumped as one of the creatures bit him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Bluma swiftly rushed past Gwen and me, drawing her swords and decapitating the creatures in one fluid motion. Beans, still shaken, let out a sigh of relief. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Thanks, Bluma... I’ve never seen them that big before..." he chuckled, and she affectionately patted his head. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Upon closer inspection, we noticed the room was filled with ransacked food, and the creatures turned out to be giant rats that were the size of Beans.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“What's with this place and giant rats and spiders?” I whispered to Gwen</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Gwen shrugged and rolled her eyes. "Alright, let's keep moving," she said, leading the way. We followed her out of the room and headed towards the other door.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As Gwen pushed the door open, the creaking of the hinges echoed through the hallway. We stepped into a large room that stretched out before us. The air was thick with dust, and the faint smell of mildew lingered, making the space feel stagnant. The room was dimly lit, with only a sliver of light filtering in through cracks in the walls.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">To Gwen’s left, a doorway led into another shadowed area, its edges worn and splintered. Farther into the room, we could see another door, half-hidden in the gloom. The walls were made of rough stone, but they were scarred—scratches, chips, and the faintest traces of paint, now faded and peeling. The floor beneath our feet was cold and uneven, worn smooth in some places, rough and jagged in others. The room had a man-made appearance, but the signs of time’s erosion were everywhere. The stone felt old, and the quiet made the room feel abandoned, as if it had been forgotten by those who once inhabited it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As each of us entered, Beans noticed a peculiar sign that seemed out of place. It read, "Welcome to Iron Hallow. Prisoners are welcome!!" with a cat drawing etched in at the end. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Well... that's reassuring," Beans chuckled. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Gwen brushed past Beans, ready to explore the other side of the room, but Bluma stopped her. Gwen glared at Bluma and whispered, "What's the big idea?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Bluma held her finger to her lips, signaling for silence. As we moved through the room, I heard the faint murmur of voices—voices I didn’t recognize, speaking in a language that wasn’t mine. Gwen seemed to pause, her posture stiffening slightly. She turned her head, listening intently, and I could see the way her brow furrowed, as if trying to place the words.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I tilted my head, confused. The sounds didn’t make sense to me, but I knew they were important to Gwen. I waited for her to explain, but she remained silent, her focus on the distant voices. I couldn’t help but wonder if they meant something to her—or if they were just as unfamiliar to her as they were to me., and eventually Beans noticed it too. Bluma placed her hand on her sword and cautiously peeked around the corner, discovering an open doorway.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Bluma and Gwen took the lead, prepared for a potential fight. Bluma glanced back at us and whispered, "</span><span class="c5">Basilisk-folk.</span><span class="c2">.." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Gwen smiled and began to move towards the door, but I grabbed her arm, attempting to stop her. "Gwen, no. I don't think they are the problem"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">She looked at me with frustration in her eyes and retorted, "Well, they could be! Why not kill them now? Even if they aren't, it would be good practice!” </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I let go of her arm and pleaded. "We need to save our strength, I don't think they are the ones that have been making the ground shake."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Gwen stared at me as I released her arm, contemplating my words. After a moment, she let go of her weapon and nodded. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I smiled, relieved that she was willing to cooperate. "Thank you... now let's try a different door," I suggested. I started walking backward, then turned around to face forward, with Gwen following suit. Bluma and Beans grumbled as they caught up, urging us to keep moving.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans and Bluma exchanged glances, then nodded, deciding to follow me. I pushed open the other door, revealing a larger room that curved around. At the end, I spotted a normal-sized rat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I grinned and waved. “Hello there.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The rat froze, its eyes wide with fear. “What!? Who are you!? Don’t eat me, please!! Don’t eat me!!”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I held my hands up, trying to appear non-threatening. “I’m not going to eat you.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The rat blinked, then hesitantly stopped panicking. “Wait… you’re not going to eat me? And you can understand me?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I nodded. “Yes, I won’t eat you. I don’t eat ani-”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The rat cut me off, its voice high with urgency. “You don’t eat!? Well, good! Because there isn’t any food here… nope! None at all!”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I sighed, feeling sorry for the rat. "I'm sorry to hear that. I was wondering if you could help us. There's a big monster down here that we've been sent to get rid of. Do you know where it is?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The rat stood in silence for a moment, then spoke up, "Um... well... There is a big monster in the middle! Um, yeah, the middle." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I chuckled and asked, "Could you show us how to get there?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The rat scratched its head, saying, "Uh, well, I use this hole, yeah. This hole. But you're too big, so I don't know."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I let out a disappointed grumble, but still maintained a smile. "Well, thank you. Here, take this." I reached into my bag and found some rations, breaking off a piece of bread and offering it to the rat. "Here is some bread."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I tossed it to the rat, which seemed confused at first. It slowly grabbed the bread, nibbled on it, then paused to stare at me before continuing to eat. I turned around and headed back to the others, a little confused as to why this rat could speak and not the ones from the cave where I met Gwen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Who was that?" Beans asked, confused by the light tone I was using.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I smiled “Oh it was a little rat, he was-”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Gwen interrupted, "A rat? First a horse, and now a rat?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans looked at her and asked, "Does he do this often?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Gwen shrugged and replied, "He talks to every animal we're not fighting, apparently."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Feeling slightly attacked, I explained, "No, guys, it's not like that. I'm not crazy. All Randeths can speak to animals, but only certain ones... It's a long story." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Bluma raised an eyebrow, and Beans glanced at her. Gwen simply shrugged, saying, "Whatever..." She then noticed a door to my right and pointed it out, asking, "Who wants to see what's in there?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">When I opened the door, I noticed another small rat cowering in the corner. Taking my time, just as I did with the previous one, I tried to calm him down. Eventually, he started speaking and told me that he was waiting for his friend. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The rat explained, "Yeah, we came in here, and then suddenly it got really warm with a bright flash. And when I turned around, he was gone! So I'm waiting."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I smiled and replied, "Alright, then we won't bother you. Here." I placed some bread on the ground in front of him. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Oh, food!" he exclaimed, running over to the enticing piece. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">However, as soon as he grabbed hold of it, the room suddenly spewed out fire, burning the bread to ashes. This caught me completely off guard, and I jumped back, and screamed, the smell of grilled rat filling the room.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Concerned, Beans and the others approached. Beans asked, "What happened?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Startled, I replied, "The rat just burst into flames!" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans then looked into the room and noticed a pressure plate along with holes scattered all over. "Well, this place is trapped. Make sure you keep a close eye out. and not fall for it yourself."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">We all nodded and continued into the room, we discovered a door at the far end.</span><span class="c2"> As I reached out to touch the door, Beans reminded me about traps and to stay vigilant. I nodded and opened the door, revealing an incredibly small room with another door at the opposite end. The room appeared to be about fifteen feet long. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Well... It doesn't look trapped," I remarked, scanning the area. After a minute, I found the string. "I've found the trap," I announced as I carefully maneuvered around it. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Once each of us had crossed safely, Gwen opened the next door. Inside, we froze. Two Basilisk-folk sat calmly, their sharp eyes locking onto ours. For a heartbeat, the room was dead silent, the tension thick enough to slice. We stared at each other, the air crackling with unspoken words, each of us sizing the other up.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c5">Bluma stood perfectly still, her expression unreadable, while Beans looked a little too unsure, shifting his weight like he wasn’t sure if this was a stare-down or an awkward meeting. I could almost hear him wondering, </span><span class="c5 c6">Are we fighting, or... are we just standing here like idiots?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Gwen noticed that they weren't attacking and observed a doorway on the other side. Keeping her sword at the ready, she cautiously walked around the side of the room. The rest of us followed suit, maintaining a distance from one another. As Gwen approached the doorway, one of the Basilisk folk rushed to block her path. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"No, you can't go that way!" he panicked, while the other one joined him and added, "Yes, you can't!" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Gwen tried to pull out her sword but I got infront of her in a panic and inquired, "why not?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The taller Basilisk-folk responded, "Because you can't! Uh... yeah!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The smaller Basilisk-folk looked at his companion confused and asked, "Why can't they?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The larger one took a moment to think and responded, "Uh... because... because... Someone told us not to let them pass!" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans chimed in, saying, "But we need to!" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The Basilisk-folk glanced at each other and then the smaller one wagged its tail and said, "Oh! Are you here to see the Lizard King?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">I then looked to Gwen who glanced at Beans, who then looked at Bluma, who then looked at me.</span><span class="c2"> In a panicked tone, I said, "Yes." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The taller Basilisk-folk spoke up, saying, "Well, you can't see him!" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Unsure of what to do next, I went along with it and asked, "But why not?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The smaller one replied, "Because we think we need to guard this way!" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Gwen interjected, "How can you be guarding something if you don't have a purpose? It's clear you don't have one."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The smaller Basilisk-folk stuttered trying to think of something and responded again, saying, "Well... we are hunting..." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans had an idea and said, "Oh, really? Well, there were some rats in a room not too far back." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The two Basilisk-folk perked up at the mention of rats. "Our traps worked, little brother!" the bigger one said to the smaller one. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans nodded and continued, "Yes! I think there were two or three of them!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Excited, the Basilisk-folk jumped over me and rushed off to see the rats. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Go, go, go!!" Beans exclaimed as he dashed out through the opposite door and down a hallway. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">We all chased after him, eventually catching up. The hallway was long and dim, except for the echoes of our feet, we walked mostly in silence to avoid alerting the l</span><span class="c5">izards</span><span class="c2">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">When we entered the new room, it was spacious and curved around a corner. As the group made their way around, I noticed another rat peacefully eating and whispered, "Don't go down the hall!" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The rat looked at me and then glanced at the hallway, panicking. "What!? Why!? What's down there? Should I stay or leave!?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Before I could calm him down, Beans accidentally tripped on a wire, causing a net to fall on him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Then Basilisk-folk came running out of the tunnel, exclaiming, "We caught a rat! Oh... it's just you again... Why are you </span><span class="c5">in our</span><span class="c2"> net?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Then the smaller one noticed the rat and eagerly exclaimed, "Oh! A rat!" He jumped on it and devoured it. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As they did so, Gwen could see the discomfort on my face as the rat’s screams of pain filled the room. A tightness twisted in my chest as I watched the lizard folk tear into it. The suddenness of it—so brutal, so cold—sent a chill down my spine. I had just spoken to the rat, and now it was being devoured right before me. My hands clenched at my sides, the helplessness gnawing at me as I struggled to look away, the scene pressing down on me with every agonizing sound.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“What are you doing down here?” the larger lizard asked, his gaze fixed on me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans attempted to deceive them once more, saying, "Uh... well, you gave us the wrong directions."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The two Basilisk-folk looked at each other, they were both confused from the looks of it and the smaller one replied, "No, we gave you the right directions."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I chimed in, saying, "Well, you did tell us about the trap." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The larger Basilisk-folk chuckled and replied, "Pfft. We set that up yesterday! Everyone should know about it by now, dumb-dumb!" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">We looked at each other and shrugged. "Well, sorry about that. We'll help you put it back together," I apologized. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The two Basilisk-folk glanced at each other and shrugged, saying, "Sure, why not?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">We then proceeded to free Beans from their net and assisted them in resetting it. Afterward, they spotted another rat and chased after it, giving us the chance to leave. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As we continued walking, Gwen grinned and teased Beans, saying, "So, Beans, what was that about avoiding traps?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans turned red with embarrassment but laughed along with her, saying, "I.. meant to do that!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I smiled and said, "Well, try not to forget again, alright, Beans?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">He nodded and replied, "Yeah, we don't know if they'll keep falling for our trick." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Gwen scoffed and said, "Keep it up? That's a little boring." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Bluma shook her head, and Beans looked at her. "We need to conserve our—" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Gwen interrupted him, saying, "Conserve our energy, yeah yeah, I know. Geez." </span><span class="c5">She rolled her eyes and crossed her arms.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I sighed and said, "Do you guys have to argue? Let's try to keep moving." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">I offered a </span><span class="c5">light-hearted</span><span class="c5"> smile as Gwen turned away</span><span class="c2">, making a disapproving sound. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans nodded and said, "Alright, focus time." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">He looked at Bluma, who patted his head and called him "Squishy." Beans chuckled at the nickname.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Observing their interaction, I asked Bluma, "Why do you call him that?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Bluma looked at me for a second, then avoided eye contact. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans chuckled and said, "Aww, Bluma." He seemed to understand what was going on, but I was lost. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans explained that it was her pet name for him, and when I asked what he called her, he said, "Oh! I call her a Spicy Nugget!" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Bluma's face turned red, and she playfully punched him while he laughed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I smiled and said, "Oh, that's cute… but aren't nuggets small?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">I wondered about the meanings behind their nicknames, but before I could inquire further, </span><span class="c5">Gwen sped  off</span><span class="c2">. "Hurry up, you guys. I want to kill whatever it is we were sent to kill." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I chuckled and remarked, "Always ready for a fight, huh?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As we walked, we passed a door and continued towards the one straight ahead. However, as we passed by, we heard the sounds of flames erupting from within and caught a whiff of cooked rats. Given my discomfort from my previous encounters with rats, I chose not to open that door.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As Gwen opened the next door, she encountered two more Basilisk-folk standing guard. As soon as they saw her, they drew their daggers and growled. One had bright green scales while the other had orange scales. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The orange lizard scowled, crossing its arms. "Who are you? And how did you get here?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Gwen didn’t even stop. She just headed for the nearest door, which led to a stairway, and called back over her shoulder, “The others told us to come this way.” She kept walking, clearly uninterested in further explanations.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The green lizard perked up, a wide grin spreading across its face. "Oh, you mean Sam and Tom?" he asked, leaning toward us with curiosity.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Yeah, those guys are awesome!” I said, nodding enthusiastically.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As they started chatting, we tried to sneak away, hoping to blend into the background. But I was the last one in the room, and just as I was about to follow the others up the stairs, the lizards hit us with another barrage of questions.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Wait—why would they be here?” Orange asked, furrowing his brow at Green.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Uh... oh! Are you guys the exterminators? Did the Great Lizard send you?” Green grinned like he had just figured everything out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans shot a nervous look at me, then stammered, “Uh, y-yeah! The Great Lizard!”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I quickly chimed in, my voice way too enthusiastic, "Oh yeah... yeah, he hired us exterminators, yup!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Green nodded excitedly. “Oh yeah, isn’t the Great Lizard just the best?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Orange hesitated, clearly uncomfortable. “Uh, maybe I don’t really—”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Before he could finish, Green jabbed him in the ribs, and Orange quickly corrected himself, “Oh, uh, yeah! He’s the best!” His nervous laugh almost made me laugh too.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I gave them both a forced smile, and realized Beans was already out of sight. I waved at the lizards, trying to sound confident. “Yeah, he is. Well, we’ll see you later!”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">With that, I hustled up the stairs to catch up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Green smiled after us. “They seem nice.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Orange sighed, his tone dark. “Yeah... probably gonna die. Those monsters are scary.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Green nodded, the smile fading from his face. “Yeah... but, uh, they’ll be fine. Probably.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As I ascended the stairs, I looked at everyone, and they all seemed to be holding back laughter. "Is everything okay?" I asked, confused. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans snickered and said, "Oh, yes, it's fine, Mr. Exterminator." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">We all burst into quiet laughter, the tension in the air easing just a little, and then followed Gwen into the next room.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As I stepped in behind her, I noticed strands of thick, silvery silk hanging from the ceiling and clinging to the walls like a webbed curtain. Gwen groaned ahead of me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Great… spiders,” she muttered, her voice laced with irritation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The sight of the webs sent a chill down my back. It brought back the memory of that first cavern we’d stumbled into—walls crawling with giant spiders, the way their legs scraped against stone, the panic in our chests.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Gwen moved cautiously now, her sword drawn and ready. I mirrored her, glancing up at the strands above, wondering if any of them were watching us from the shadows.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The room stretched out, curving around a corner. As we approached the corner and peeked around, we discovered more webs and a door. Remaining vigilant for traps, we moved closer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Upon entering the next room, we noticed spherical orbs of webbing clustered in the corner, with a door located on the opposite end. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Confused, I asked, "What are these?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Bluma looked to Beans and muttered: "Splich?"  </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Gwen shivered and remarked, "A splich? I'd rather deal with spiders."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"What's a splich?" I inquired, my curiosity piqued. "I've never heard of it before."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans pondered for a moment and replied, "Most people don't survive after encountering one. The stories vary but they are bad news, stay on guard." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Gwen pointed toward the webbed clusters lining the walls. “Burn the web-orb things, Bushy,” she said. “I’d rather not deal with them or the splich on our way back.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I held out my hand and set the nearest one ablaze. The fire caught quickly, crackling through the silk. As the flames spread, I caught Beans staring at his hands, eyebrows furrowed. He looked back up without saying anything, and we moved on through the next doorway.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The room we entered was wide, with a second doorway on the same wall we came through and a staircase directly across from it. Unfortunately, this chamber had even more of those webbed orbs—bigger ones.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Burn them too,” Gwen muttered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I stepped forward, flames at the ready—but before I could strike, one of the orbs burst open. A large, glowing spider-like creature lunged at me with startling speed, launching a sticky strand of web straight at my face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I stumbled back with a yelp and threw the fire instinctively. The flames slammed into it, and the creature screeched as it caught fire, writhing in pain.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"It's a splich!" Gwen shouted, drawing her sword along with Bluma. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">They launched an attack, with Gwen landing the first blow and severing some of the creature's legs. It shrieked and lunged at me with its fangs bared, but Bluma swiftly struck it down, causing it to squirt out glowing yellow blood.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Before Beans could make an attempt, another splich emerged from the other side of the room, shooting a web at him and trying to reel him closer. Beans stumbled, grasping onto the floor's broken tiles, he pulled back, breaking free from the web's grasp. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">The splich</span><span class="c5"> </span><span class="c2">tried to jump out at Beans however he managed to pull out his ax and smack it away. The splich landed on its back then hurriedly scrambled to its feet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As the creature scuttled away, I tried to call out—but the web was still plastered across my face. I clawed at it, stumbling back, but the sticky threads clung tight, sealing over my mouth and nose. Panic bubbled up in my chest. I dropped to my knees, fingers fumbling at the strands, but they stretched like glue. My heart pounded as I yanked harder, growling in frustration.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I could barely hear the others over the muffled sound in my ears, just the thrum of my own pulse and the sharp rasp of my breath.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Gwen chuckled and grabbed a cross-bolt to cut me out. I quickly stood up and looked around, asking, "What happened!?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Gwen smiled and replied, "Oh, nothing too serious." She then walked over to the dead splich and stuck her sword into it. "Which way now, boss?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I stood up, surveying the area, seeing that the room had two doors. I opened the closest door and saw a short staircase, walking up, I discovered a dead end to my left, but to my right, there was a long hallway that stretched beyond my line of sight. "..hmm Hey Beans! What does the other door look like?" I asked, reluctant to venture down the dark corridor. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans opened his door and yelled back, "Looks like the room takes a turn around a corner, but besides more silk, not much."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I descended the stairs and said, "Well, let's go that way first." Gwen, still gripping her sword and began moving toward the door, with Bluma and me following suit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Upon entering, we discovered four more doorways, but none with doors. "For the love... Why can't the big bad evil guy just show up already!? I want to fight them!" Gwen exclaimed in frustration.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I chuckled and reassured her, "We'll find them soon, Gwen. I want to get this over with as much as you do.." Gwen groaned in response </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans then took a look at all the doorways “Deta and Gwen, you both take a door, and I'll take this one in front of me. Bluma, you could stand in between so that if something goes wrong, you can reach any of us the fastest."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Bluma nodded, and each of us headed towards a doorway. I barely had time to take a step before something struck my back—thick, sticky webbing latching onto me like a trap. I yelled out, reaching for the doorframe, but the force yanked me off my feet and dragged me backward across the floor.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">From the corner of my eye, I saw Gwen get snatched in the same instant, her sword clattering to the ground as she struggled. Beans shouted something—cut off as a strand wrapped around his arm and wrenched him off balance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I twisted, trying to burn the web with a spark, but the strands were too fast, too strong. We were all pulled toward the dark room ahead, helpless against the pull. I caught a glimpse of Bluma lunging forward, arms outstretched for Beans—but she vanished behind the silk just as he was yanked through the doorway.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As I was dragged in, I saw I was being pulled by a large splich. It attempted to bite me, but through a sloppy dodge that landed me on the floor, the splich hit the wall and fell to the ground. In a panic, scrambling to get off the floor, I extended my hands, trying to cast fire. To my surprise, just as the spider got up and tried to rush me, a sphere made of flames formed between me and the splich, causing it to jump backward in confusion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"What... what the heck!?" I muttered, eyes wide in disbelief.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As I jolted my hand back out of shock, the fireball followed, keeping the same distance from me. Moving my hand to the side, I watched as it trailed obediently, still hovering. Suddenly, the splich jumped at me again. Instinctively, I swung my arm around, and the ball of fire engulfed the creature in an instant.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">For a moment, I thought it was over, but the splich, burning and enraged, managed to sink its fangs into my arm. Pain shot through me as it clamped down harder, its strength not yet spent. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I screamed as the splich bit into my arm, trying to tear it off. The fireball I’d summoned was still burning the creature, but not fast enough. My lack of control was dragging the fight on. With my other arm trapped, I couldn’t reach for anything else, and I was terrified of burning myself with the flames.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I looked towards the doorway in hopes someone might be able to help me, but saw a strange figure with a bow and arrow pointing at me. I tried to move the ball of fire to the man but the splich ripped off a chunk of my arm then quickly bit down again causing me to yell out in pain and the fireball to slam on the ground, putting it out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The splich latched onto my arm, its pincers digging into the stone and bark of my body, trying to chew through like I was meat. I shouted, twisting, trying to slam it against the wall—but it clung tighter, shrieking with each impact.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">A sudden thud hit the floor nearby—something fast, heavy. Then a loud twang echoed through the chamber, followed by a sharp crack and a yelp from the creature. Something hard smacked into its side—maybe a blade, maybe a blunt edge—and it reeled back, shrieking as it finally let go.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I hit the floor, gasping, just as two more sharp strikes pierced the Splich. One stabbed straight through its bulbous head, the other into its abdomen. The monster gave one last spasm, then slumped, unmoving.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I looked up in a daze, breathing hard. Gwen stood over me, sword drawn and panting. Bluma was beside her, silent but still and tense, her own blade pulled free from the creature’s twitching form.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans skidded into the room behind them and rushed to my side, grabbing my arm. "You good, Deta?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I winced, sitting up slowly. "Not really. But I think I will be."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Gwen’s gaze flicked toward the doorway, her expression tightening. "We have company..."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">As we turned to look, we found ourselves face-to-face with four other individuals staring right back at us.</span><hr/></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><h5 class="c7 c23" id="h.26in1rg"><span class="c21">CHAPTER 11</span><span class="c13 c8">                                                                                                                         From a Camp to an Army</span></h5><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As I gazed at the four men, I noticed the diverse range of races and sizes among them. I was taken aback by the presence of humans down here, so I asked them, "What brings the four of you down here?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">A scruffy, short Dwarf cleared his throat, donning a rusty old chest plate and sporting a jet-black beard with a streak of white in it. "Well, we were just sitting by our camp... and noticed a damsel in distress," he replied with a chuckle, while Gwen seemed ready to unleash her fury.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"> "Why, you little..." she began, reaching for her sword to pick it out of the splich. Quickly, I stepped in front of her, and Bluma attempted to calm her down.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Thank you," I expressed with a smile, hoping to prevent Gwen from attacking them. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The old Dwarf chuckled in response, "Not a problem. We are all prisoners down here..." His eyes fell upon Beans, who wore the king's crest on their armor, a symbol typical of knights and squires. Then, his attention shifted to Bluma, who stared back at him. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">His gaze </span><span class="c5">turned</span><span class="c2"> cold with malice. "You..." he uttered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Bluma narrowed her eyes, unamused. "Baltimore," she said curtly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">At the sound of her voice, his expression twitched. He blinked, once, like he couldn’t believe she had the nerve to speak to him that way. His jaw tensed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">"Bluma," he muttered, low and sharp, then took a step forward. "Of course it’s </span><span class="c5 c6">you</span><span class="c2"> down here. Always so damn quiet, like you’re better than the rest of us. Still playing bodyguard for strangers, I see."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">She didn’t respond, just watched him with the same unreadable stillness she always had.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">His nostrils flared. “What the hell are you even doing down here?” he snapped, voice rising. “You uptight little knight!”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The other prisoners exchanged confused glances, clearly unsure of what to make of the outburst.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans, on the other hand, stepped forward, face tightening with growing fury. “Hey!” he snapped, fists clenched at his sides. “You don’t get to talk to her like that.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I blinked, surprised by the sharpness in his voice. Even Gwen raised an eyebrow, while Bluma said nothing, her blank face somehow seeming even more unreadable than usual.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Baltimore scoffed, “What, the squire’s gonna lecture me now?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Try me,” Beans growled, taking another step forward. There was no trace of his usual nervousness now—just raw protectiveness burning behind his eyes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Easy,” I said, instinctively holding a hand up between them, though I wasn’t sure who I was trying to calm down.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Baltimore raised his hands mockingly and leaned back against the wall. “Fine, fine. I’m not here to make friends anyway.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">That didn’t stop Beans from glaring holes through him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Gwen muttered under her breath, “Well… this just got interesting.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"What's a knight doing down here?" an Elf asked, eyeing Bluma with an unreadable expression. His voice held a mix of curiosity and skepticism.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The human beside him shrugged, seemingly uninterested. "I don't know... maybe she got exiled? Look, she still has her armor and the king's crest. Doesn't look like someone who's fallen out of favor."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Their conversation barely registered with Bluma as she kept her gaze fixed ahead, but the Dwarf’s voice suddenly broke through the murmurs. He was yelling at Bluma, calling her names and questioning her worth. The insults grated against the air, and it didn’t take long for Beans to tense up beside me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">His usual hesitation evaporated as his anger flared. "Hey, back off!" Beans barked, stepping toward the Dwarf, his face flushed with indignation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The Dwarf’s eyes flicked to Beans, a twisted smile creeping onto his face as he grabbed a rusty blade from his belt. "You got a problem with me, boy?" he sneered, advancing toward him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Bluma’s hand shot to her black longsword before any words could be exchanged. The blade was drawn with deadly precision, its dark sheen glinting in the dim light. But just as tension reached its peak, the Elf acted swiftly, seizing the Dwarf by his hair and pulling him back with a surprising amount of force.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Enough!" the Elf snapped, his voice firm and commanding. "We welcome you four, regardless of the circumstances. There's no escape from this place, so there's no point in fighting."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Baltimore, still fuming, grunted, crossing his arms tightly over his chest. "Whatever, you stupid elf," he muttered under his breath. "Let’s just get back to camp." Without another word, he turned and stormed off, his boots echoing through the stone corridor.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The human and other </span><span class="c3">figures</span><span class="c3"> followed</span><span class="c3"> the Dwarf, while the Elf </span><span class="c0">turned back to us. "I apologize for his behavior. Come on! Let us lead you back to our camp! We are all prisoners to Iron Hallow."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bluma looked at Beans, who nodded in agreement. Reluctantly, she agreed as well and let out a sigh. However, Gwen crossed her arms and expressed her skepticism. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"You two can go, but I'd rather cut them up," she remarked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I sighed, trying to reason with her. "Gwen, come on. This gives us a chance to rest in a safer area of this dungeon for a while." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She rolled her eyes. "What if it's a trap to lure us in with a false sense of security and strip us of our gear, then take us prisoner?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shaking my head, I assured her, "If that's the case, we won't be fooled. The moment you sense something suspicious, let us know, and we'll leave, alright?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Gwen gestured towards the Elf and the others. "Are you telling me that </span><span class="c3">THAT isn't suspicious</span><span class="c0">!?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Elf chuckled awkwardly, and I groaned. "Gwen, please. They are better than dealing with those splich creatures." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She groaned in reluctant agreement. As we followed the Elf and the others towards their campsite, I noticed several hallways branching off, each crowded with people. The corridors seemed to lead to small rooms where prisoners lived. As we continued, we were led into a large, round chamber with halls stretching in every direction. The Elf stepped forward, approaching a man clad in what looked like scrap armor, and began speaking with him in low tones. Meanwhile, figures in the hallways peeked out, their eyes on us, whispering among themselves.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Tch... where are they taking us?" Gwen murmured, her mistrust evident. She held her sword tightly, ready for any sudden movements. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beans looked around and commented, "I'm not entirely sure, but the farther we go, the more this resembles a dwarven city." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Just then, one of the men hurried down one of the halls.</span><span class="c0"> The Elf turned back to us, sporting a smile. "Right this way," he gestured, indicating the path the man had taken.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We exchanged glances, each of us now prepared for whatever might happen, and proceeded down that hallway. It was wide and well-lit, with torches placed every ten feet, providing clear visibility. Gwen and Bluma kept their swords at the ready, anticipating any potential threats, while Beans and I remained vigilant for any traps along the way.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We proceeded through the uneventful hallway and entered a large room guarded by stationed guards. At the center of the back wall, there stood a throne constructed from metal scraps, bones and wood. Seated upon the throne was a towering Orcish person, adorned in remnants of armor and a makeshift crown. As we approached, he greeted us with a crooked smile. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Welcome. We are glad you have managed to make it safely here. My name is Albuquerque the Half-Orc, but you can call me Ale. I am the chieftain of this dungeon."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Returning his smile, I replied, "It's a pleasure to meet you, Ale." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The chieftain chuckled at my response. "Now, if I may ask, what brings you down here? What did you do to be sent here? Who did you kill?" This caused the whole room of people to  burst out laughing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I hesitated, aware that revealing the truth about the king sending us could potentially make enemies out of them. "Well, actually, we came down here by choice." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Silence flooded the room, heavy and unsettling, as if the very air had stilled around us. I could hear Gwen sigh from behind me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ale leaned forward, sitting on the edge of his throne, and spoke with a hint of suspicion in his voice, "By choice, you say... Why?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Panic surged within me, as I tried to come up with a plausible explanation. Beans, equally nervous, struggled to contain his flatulence but let out a faint squeak. Which made everyone burst out in awkward laughter.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Coughing slightly, I continued, "Well, we had heard tales of a mighty and powerful lizard residing here. We have come to challenge and slay the beast." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The chief leaned back in his chair, scratching his chin thoughtfully. "Slay the beast, hmm?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I nodded eagerly, adding, "Yes! And perhaps we could seek your assistance in this endeavor?" I chuckled nervously, but Ale responded with a menacing glare. He summoned one of the guards and whispered something to them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The guard nodded, and the chief turned back to us. "I’m surprised you were able to know of this great beast.. Maybe that means some of the men made it out and turned tail on us…," he growled and declared, rising from his throne and approaching us. "We shall embark on this venture together. However!”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">His voice echoed loudly through the room and everyone still holding their weapons out gripped them tighter.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ale stood in front of me and put his hand on my shoulder. “Not before giving you time to rest and showing you around." A warm smile replaced his previous menacing expression. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I believe we were all surprised by that but I expressed my gratitude. Ale led us down a hallway to the left, guiding us on a tour of the area. "These are forgeries," he explained. "This place used to be a dwarven kingdom, but one day, The current royal house was built over the ruins. The forge itself is broken, so we can't do much with it, but we make do." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Peering inside, we observed individuals of various races and genders, attempting to repair the forge and hammer away at the metal, only to face repeated failures.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As Ale chuckled, Beans remarked, "Wow, there are lots of people in there. I thought prisoners would fight to the death down here…" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ale nodded in acknowledgment. "Indeed, some of them were born here. This is all they've ever known. We hope that one day we can escape and give our children a better life..." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bluma didn’t say much. I could tell she wasn’t focused on his words—just staring ahead with that quiet calm she always had. I knew she believed the children were innocent, but that their parents… had earned what came to them. She probably helped send some of them down there, after all.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We continued the tour, with Ale showing us a few more rooms. Finally, we reached their farmhouse. Upon entering, I was disheartened by the lack of plant life and the dirty water. Determined, I walked into the center of the room and sat down. Ale raised an eyebrow as a green light emanated from me. Some of the people in the room raised makeshift spears, ready to attack, but an Elf intervened.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Calm down, brothers. He's using magic. I'm not sure what kind, but it doesn’t seem dangerous." Gradually, the people lowered their spears. </span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16 c8 c6 c17">Gwen’s View</span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c3 c8 c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ale turned to me and the others, informing us that the tour was complete and we would reconvene the next morning at the sound of the horn. With a slight bow, he departed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I sighed in frustration. "Great. Now what do we do?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beans seemed to think for a moment before suggesting, "Well... I kind of want to see the forge again. Maybe I could help with the repairs?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bluma, arms crossed, reluctantly nodded. She didn't trust some of the people, but she had to keep up appearances. With a sigh, she joined Beans in heading back to the forge to lend a hand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I rolled my eyes, glanced at Deta, and sighed before setting off to find something to do.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16 c8 c6 c17">Deta’s View</span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c3 c8 c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A few hours later, some people returned to the farm, dropping their weapons as they entered. They were met with an astonishing sight—the once barren land had transformed. Lush greenery now covered the area, with healthy crops and even fruit trees sprouting. I remained seated on the ground, surrounded by blooming flowers. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One of the men tapped my shoulder and asked, "Excuse me... did... Did you do this?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I stood up and smiled. "Yes, I did."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The men expressed their joy and gratitude for the transformed land. They were thankful that their families would finally have fresh food. They asked if they could do anything to show their appreciation, but I simply requested they take care of their families. With nods of agreement, they eagerly began harvesting. Feeling drained from using magic, I left the farm and wandered through the camp.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I watched as</span><span class="c0"> Bluma roamed the camp, observing how the prisoners had managed to create a semblance of life in the dungeon. As she walked, she noticed a few hooded men watching her intently. Beans, on the other hand, was exploring the forge, asking questions and immersing himself in the workshop. Bluma leaned against a wall, watching him with a soft chuckle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Suddenly, a large man wearing a tattered hood approached Bluma and requested her presence. Intrigued, she followed him to the training room, where several men and women were sparring. As she entered, the combat stopped, and all eyes turned to her. Without warning, a man charged at her from behind with a rusty dagger. Bluma swiftly evaded the attack, disarmed him, and tossed him aside. The others readied themselves for a fight, but Bluma drew her sword, ready to teach them a lesson without causing serious harm</span><span class="c0">.<br/>        Eventually, I found Gwen in the training area, pushing the prisoners to improve their combat skills. She was relentless, urging them to persevere and warning them of potential dangers. I chuckled softly at her determination and continued exploring. I stumbled upon a room where many people were sleeping, cared for by a compassionate woman. She smiled gently and offered me a place to rest. Grateful, I thanked her and settled down.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The following day, we prepared for the upcoming battle. Ale, Gwen, Bluma, Beans, and I gathered to discuss the plan. Ale informed us that the reptile we sought resided in the dungeon’s central area, surrounded by rooms infested with spliches. We acknowledged the need for caution and speed to avoid detection. Ale rallied his men, emphasizing the significance of defeating the serpent as a means to secure their freedom. The men cheered, fueled by hope for a future outside the dungeon. With our combined force of about forty, we set out confidently, listening to their voices as they shared dreams of life beyond the dungeon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen and Baltimore seemed to fight for leading the way, I turned to Ale, who was focused and ready. "Ale, if you make it out, what are your plans for the future?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My question caught Bluma's attention. She seemed to lean in a little, as if she were eager to hear the answer. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ale took a deep breath before answering. "Well... I think I'll seek a peaceful life. In the past, I was just a tool of war. Nothing could stop me," he said, clenching his fist. "But that thrill faded. Taking lives no longer gave me fulfillment." He looked at me and smiled. "Once I’m out, I plan to rediscover myself." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I smiled back. "That sounds like a good plan." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ale chuckled and playfully raised his fist. "You're alright, Plant Man." I bumped my fist against his. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Thanks. You're pretty alright too." We both laughed, but it stopped as we reached the next room.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As we entered, we found the halls choked with sticky webs. Green spheres had sprouted since our last time here, clustered tightly across the corridor like some sick imitation of a wall. But no Splichs stirred in sight, and we decided to lead the army forward.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That was a mistake.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just as we maneuvered to turn around, the webs behind us twitched—snapping underweight. Basilisk-folk poured in, not slithering like I expected, but running—some on two legs, some on four, armed with hooked spears and jagged shields. We barely had time to form a defense.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was chaos.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen shouted orders. Bluma took the front line, her sword flashing in the dim torchlight. Beans ducked low, swinging his axe with precision, while Ale’s staff pulsed with purple light, casting illusions to disorient our attackers. I fought beside Gwen, slashing and shielding, trying to keep the Basilisks from breaking our formation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But there were too many.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For every one we knocked down, two more surged from the side tunnels. A red-scaled one lunged at me with fangs bared—I blocked the bite just in time, but the force knocked me off my feet. I scrambled up, only to see Ale nearly impaled by a long pike. Gwen tackled the attacker before it struck true.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“This is bad!” I gasped, backing toward a wall.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ale turned, scanning the scene—our army was being cut down or cornered, our fighters scattered. He looked like he wanted to argue with fate itself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Retreat!” he yelled, voice cracking under the weight of it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We broke up. There was no formation left—only a desperate scramble to survive. We sprinted through webbed halls and past the green globes, some bursting underfoot and leaking sickly fluid. It took what felt like hours to find a pocket of safety—a collapsed section where the Basilisks couldn't easily follow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We collapsed there. I could barely breathe.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ale stood near the edge, looking pale. “Half the army... they didn’t make it,” he whispered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen sat with a grunt, tearing cloth to wrap a deep gash on her arm. Beans and I moved from one injured soldier to another, using what healing we could spare. The air buzzed with pain, fear, and doubt.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then Baltimore snapped.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"You knew we’d die!" he screamed, staggering to his feet. "You never intended to kill the Lizard King! You led us here to die!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But then he froze, eyes locked past me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I turned—and my stomach dropped.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A hundred Basilisk-folk, maybe more, lined the hall behind us. No longer rushing. No longer fighting. They moved like they already knew they'd won.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A towering blue Basilisk with feathery wings stepped forward. His voice was gravel smoothed by smoke. “Tie them up. The Lizard King will decide their fate.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We fought, of course—we tried—but it was over before it began. We were outnumbered, surrounded, broken.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They bound our wrists and marched us in a line. Gwen and I ended up just behind Baltimore. Beans, Bluma, and Ale were further back, watching silently. The air hung thick with mildew and rot, and the only sounds were footsteps and the drag of rope on stone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Baltimore wouldn't stop muttering—angry, venomous words—and Gwen snapped. She kicked him hard behind the knee, sending him stumbling.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"What the hell!?" he barked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She spat at his feet. “Screw you, Baltimore. If you’d stayed behind, we wouldn’t be in this mess.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He whirled around, shouting again—but a tall orange Basilisk slammed the butt of his spear into Baltimore’s head. He dropped without another word. The Basilisk slung him over a shoulder and moved to the front.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then we walked—silent, humiliated, bound. Every step took us deeper, the stone walls damp and narrowing, as if the dungeon itself wanted to swallow us whole.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I felt a rush of nerves go through my body causing me to shake slightly and pull my arms up. After a few seconds I realized, the ropes weren't on me, looking at my wrist I could see bits of the rope hairs stuck on some of the wood and rocks on my wrist… how long was I free? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">In a panic I looked around, and seeing a Basilisk walking towards us I grew vines and had them wrap around my wrists hoping to trick them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Just as I did so a guttural voice rumbled from behind me. "Keep moving!"  a green Basilisk with slitted yellow eyes, shoved me forward with the butt of its spear. I stumbled but managed to keep my balance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Once he walked away toward the front of the group, I looked to Gwen and saw her quicken her breathing and sweat began to form. </span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c3 c8 c6"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16 c6 c17">Gwen’s View</span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">My thoughts spiraled out of control, like waves crashing over me, threatening to drag me under. </span><span class="c5 c6">"Stay calm. Breathe. You’re fine. It’s just rope."</span><span class="c5"> I tried to convince myself, but the words felt hollow, as if I were grasping at smoke. The panic swelled in my chest, my heart hammering so violently it was as if my rib cage could no longer contain it. </span><span class="c5 c6">GET THIS OFF OF ME!</span><span class="c2"> The scream echoed in my mind, rattling louder than anything around me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The ropes felt too tight, suffocating, like they were pressing into my skin, into my bones. My breath came in shallow gasps, each one more desperate than the last, like I couldn't get enough air. It was happening again—I’m trapped!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Flashes of past horrors flooded my mind. The feeling of being bound, helpless, vulnerable—left to rot, or worse. My throat tightened as if I were reliving every moment of those torturous days. </span><span class="c5 c6">I'm not okay! I'm never getting out of this... I'm going to be trapped here forever!</span><span class="c2"> I could barely think beyond the panic, my vision blurring as tears filled my eyes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8 c6 c14">I can’t do this again…</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The dark thoughts wrapped around me tighter than the ropes, squeezing the hope out of me. It was as if the air around me thickened, making it harder to breathe, harder to think. My body tensed—every muscle locked, my mind screaming at me to either run or give in, to stop the torment that gnawed at my sanity.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">But then, something shifted—a small, barely noticeable movement. At first, I couldn't make sense of it. My hand felt something, a brush of motion, soft but distinct. Blinking through the haze of panic, I forced myself to look down.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Deta was behind me, his arms no longer tied behind his back, somehow, he'd managed to free himself. He was so focused on the rope, his fingers working at the knots of rope that bound me, silently undoing my restraints.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">I was still trapped in my own head, my mind fought him. </span><span class="c5 c6">It’s not enough. He </span><span class="c5 c6">can't</span><span class="c5 c6"> save me, We</span><span class="c5 c8 c6 c14"> won’t make it out of this. It’s just another trick, another way to break me...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">T</span><span class="c5">hen I felt my hand had somehow found its way to him, my fingers wrapping around his pinky. It was small, almost insignificant, but it was real. He didn’t flinch, didn’t hesitate. That tiny touch became my anchor, I wanted to let go and get out myself… but my grip tightened as if holding on was the only thing keeping me from drowning.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c8 c6 c14 c16">Deta’s View</span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c5 c8 c6 c14"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I looked at her, and to my relief, she had stopped sweating profusely, and her breathing was gradually slowing down. I smiled, realizing that she understood I was genuinely trying to help her, and </span><span class="c3">also glad she didn't intend to tear my pinky off</span><span class="c0">, as her grip began to loosen even though she was still twisting it painfully.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Alright, everyone, line up in the center!" a commanding voice boomed as we approached a large cave entrance. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As we entered the cave, the lighting seemed dim to me, but some of the human prisoners grumbled about not being able to see properly. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Tch... humans," Gwen muttered, rolling her eyes. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">"Can you see </span><span class="c3">in here</span><span class="c0">?" I expressed surprise. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She looked unimpressed. "Yes, I'm half elf. We can see in dark places." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I chuckled and said, "Oh, that makes sense!... Wait, you're half elf?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She sighed. "Yeah, yeah. Now hurry and untie me. The Lizards forgot to take away people's armor and weapons." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Oh, right, good idea... but can I use my pinky?" I asked. As soon as the words left my mouth, she quickly released her grip, and I let out a sigh of relief, grateful that her grasp was no longer causing pain.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Bluma, surveying the surroundings, noticed that every wall appeared normal except for one that seemed slightly convex. To the west, a portion of the wall appeared distinct. Several </span><span class="c3">Basilisk-folk</span><span class="c0"> congregated in the center and began hissing and screeching, causing the wall to shift. Everyone froze as the wall moved, revealing itself to be a huge dragon with fiery red scales. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With a large yawn the dragon unleashed a blast of flames, engulfing nine prisoners and claiming their lives. "Who dares awaken me from my slumber?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The large orange Basilisk-folk, who appeared minuscule in comparison, spoke up. "Oh, great Lizard King! We have brought you a sacrifice! We hope it pleases you!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">All the Basilisk-folk prostrated themselves before the dragon, redirecting its attention to our group.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The dragon grinned menacingly. "Very good... it has been a long time since </span><span class="c3">I feasted on flesh this fresh</span><span class="c0">." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The room grew hotter and brighter as the dragon's scales radiated a vibrant orange glow. One of its wings appeared to have been torn off, while the other spread out like a rolling sunset. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The dragon then approached our group, consisting of nine survivors and nine charred bodies. It reached down and devoured the burnt victims with a chuckle. "Medium rare... quite delightful," it remarked, relishing the grisly feast.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Meanwhile, Gwen glanced back towards the entrance. "Something is coming," she warned. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I turned my attention to the path we had traversed and heard faint hissing noises that grew louder. The dragon paused its feast, acknowledging the escalating hissing sound that echoed throughout the room. Suddenly, a colossal snake emerged from the entrance, towering in size similar to the dragon. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The dragon sneered upon seeing the colossal snake enter. “You're still alive…" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The snake spoke with disdain. "</span><span class="c3">Unlike you</span><span class="c0"> shall be here soon!!" With a resolute charge, the giant snake trampled over most of the Basilisk-folk, engaging in a cataclysmic battle with the dragon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The ground shook as the dragon and snake tumbled, those of us who were still standing were forcefully struck by the serpent's tail and flung against a wall. Gwen and I tumbled to the ground.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I quickly got up and went to Gwen who was face first on the ground. </span><span class="c3">“Hurry up and untie me, Bushy!” She yelled</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I pulled at the rope and finished untying her. “You're free! What is that thing?" I asked, bewildered. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She stood up as fast as she could and retrieved her crossbow and fired a bolt at the dragon. "It's a giant snake and dragon what's it look like!!" she then rushed towards Bluma to free her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I ran to Beans and pulled the ropes off him, he stood up and pulled out his ax, "It's the Guardian Serpent!" Beans watched their fight and upon turning alerted us, "Behind you!" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Three Basilisk-folk attempted to ambush us. "You're not getting away!" they yelled in unison. Before I could even reach for my weapon, Ale swung his glowing staff, sending the trio flying through the air. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Are you two alright?" he asked, concern etched on his face. Beans and I nodded in response. "Good! Now let's aid the Serpent!" he declared, charging into the fray to battle the Basilisk-folk.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Beans looked at me as we rose to our feet, preparing our weapons. Gwen then untied </span><span class="c2">Bluma from the ropes along with a few other prisoners, and we charge towards the battling serpent, dragon, and Basilisk-folk. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The Serpent's powerful strike and coiling caused the dragon to fall, shaking the entire cavern. As they fell over, the ground beneath us began to crack, and we realized the danger. Bluma and Gwen quickly rush towards us, attempting to pull us away from the potential collapse. As the two ran towards us the floor gave out from underneath us and them, sending us plummeting into the dark abyss below.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The four of us, along with some prisoners and Basilisk-folk, plummet into the abyss. Screams echo all around us, and panic ensues. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">In the midst of the chaos, Beans shouts, "Use your scrolls!" and he pulls out his own. The three of us </span><span class="c5">took</span><span class="c2"> out our scrolls, and upon speaking the writing on them, a light gray aura formed around us, slowing our descent. I glance at Bluma and Beans with a sense of relief.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Bushy!!” Gwen screamed. I snapped my head around just in time to see her plummeting, her scroll malfunctioning, spiraling out of control. Dread crept in my chest as she disappeared into the darkness below. Panic surged through me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Gwen!!” I  shouted, my voice breaking with terror.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I spun toward Bluma, my eyes wild with desperation. “Bluma—throw me!”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Without hesitation, Bluma kicked off the wall and shot toward me. With every ounce of her strength, she launched me into the abyss after Gwen. Wind whipped past my ears as I plummeted through the void. I caught a glimpse of her, just a shadow now, falling faster than I could reach.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I cursed, frustration boiling inside me as I continued to slow down.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">In one frantic motion, I summoned my thorn whip, feeling it thrash violently in my grip. My mind raced. I had to act fast. I tied an empty potion bottle to its end, giving it weight. With a wild swing, I hurled it toward Gwen, desperation in every movement.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The whip snapped tight. I felt it catch her leg. Relief flooded me as her descent slowed, but my heart still thundered, knowing we were both far from safe.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Are you okay?" I ask Gwen, my voice filled with concern. I started receding the whip causing me to pull in closer to her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">She looked at me, her face a mixture of fear and relief. "What do you think?! I almost died!" Her face bore a frightened and annoyed expression. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">After a moment, we spot the ground approaching, and we brace ourselves for the impact. Upon landing, Gwen quickly untangles my vine whip from her leg. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">I am about to speak when she interrupts, her voice filled with reluctant gratitude. "Thank you... This is the second time you've saved my life."</span><hr/></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><h5 class="c7 c23" id="h.lnxbz9"><span class="c21">CHAPTER 12</span><span class="c13 c8">                                                                                                                                 In the Dark</span></h5><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I smiled and replied, "No problem. Besides, I owe you one for helping me with that splich yesterday." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">She shook her head. "No, Bluma did most of the work, so I'm still in debt." Then she turned to me and said, "Don't think you're getting rid of me until I repay that and have you owe me!" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I smiled and chuckled, saying, "Sounds like a deal." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Suddenly, we heard a faint yell from above. "Hey! Are you guys okay?" We looked up and saw Bluma with Beans waving at us. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"We're good!" I shouted back, "But hurry and come down here so we can go back up!" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans chuckled. They both then landed next to us. Beans looked around and asked, "Where are we?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">We all froze when Gwen spoke up, her voice so soft it barely reached us over the distant echo of dripping water.<br/> "We're in the Underworld."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The words settled like a curse in the air.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I looked around slowly, my breath catching. Towering caverns stretched endlessly in every direction, cloaked in shadow and silence. Jagged stalagmites jutted up from the stone floor like fangs, while thick stalactites dripped from the ceiling above, some so long they nearly kissed the ground. The air felt thick and damp, clinging to my skin, and every step echoed too loud—like the cave itself was listening.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"The Underworld?!" Beans’ voice cracked as he stumbled back a step, the sound bouncing off the rock walls in jagged fragments. His wide eyes flicked to Bluma, who gave a slow, grim nod. Even without words, her meaning was unmistakable. Whatever this place was, it was bad.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">That nod alone sent a cold spike down my spine.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I turned to Beans, trying to grasp what they already seemed to know.<br/> "The... Underworld?" I repeated, uncertain. The name meant nothing to me—just a word—but the look in their eyes told me enough. Gwen’s pale face. Beans’ trembling hands. Bluma’s clenched jaw. They were terrified.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans whipped around, eyes darting like something might leap from the dark at any moment. He leaned in, voice just above a whisper.<br/> "Shh! Don’t say it like that!" he hissed. "The Underworld is a place no one wants to be. Everything down here—everything—is twisted. Evil."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">A low wind stirred through the cavern, but it carried no scent and made no sound. It felt </span><span class="c5 c6">wrong</span><span class="c2">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As if on cue, a deafening roar echoed through the cavern, sending a shiver down my back. Bluma wasted no time, yanking us behind a nearby stalagmite.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Quiet," she hissed, her eyes darting around. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The thumping of heavy footsteps grew louder, shaking the ground beneath us. Against my better judgment, I leaned out to see what was causing the noise. I froze, as I spotted a massive stone creature, its body blending seamlessly with the stalagmites.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The creature crawled up the wall and clung to the ceiling, finally going still. I exhaled in shaky relief— I shrill squeak then echoed by us. I turned to Beans as the last time I heard that, it came from him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">He turned bright red. "Sorry," he whispered, his voice trembling with fear.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Move," Bluma whispered urgently. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans and I nodded, inching forward behind her. But as I glanced back, I noticed Gwen, still crouched behind the stalagmite, her face pale. Her whole body was trembling, her breath coming out in rapid, shallow gasps. She didn’t look like she could move at all.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Gwen?" I called softly, stepping toward her. No response. Her eyes were wide, fixed on some distant point in the cavern, unblinking.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I reached out slowly, my hand barely brushing her arm. She jerked back violently, eyes wide with terror. "Don't touch me!" she cried out, her voice echoing through the vast cavern. The sound made everyone freeze. Bluma and Beans turned to her, wide-eyed, as Gwen clamped her hand over her mouth, tears welling in her eyes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The creatures began crawling down from the cave's roof, resembling the colossal one we had seen before. "Run!" Bluma yelled as the monster started descending the wall. Gwen, Beans, and I sprinted alongside her, the monsters chasing after us, their stone legs pounding loudly against the cave floor. Bluma made a sharp left turn, and when Gwen and I followed, we froze, nearly falling off a cliff. Looking ahead, I saw Bluma running along the edge toward a rock bridge stretching across a giant crevasse.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Come on, Gwen!" I urged, and she nodded as we ran as fast as we could. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Just as we reached the bridge, the stone monsters burst around the corner. Some tumbled into the crevasse, while others pursued us onto the bridge. As I watched some of them fall, I noticed a bright red light at the very bottom, where they seemed to disappear.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Gwen and I reached the midpoint of the bridge when some of the stones gave way, and I almost fell. Gwen looked back and rushed to my aid. "Deta!" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">She helped me up, and an idea struck me. "Gwen, go! I have an idea!" I turned toward the approaching creatures. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"You idiot! You're going to die!" Gwen protested, but I extended my hand, summoning a large ball of fire.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Just go!" I shouted. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Reluctantly, Gwen ran off as I hurled the fireball at the bridge, hoping to destroy it. A few cracks formed beneath the impact, but before I could strike again, the fireball fizzled out and suddenly exploded, knocking me back and scorching my skin.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Frustrated, I tried to summon the fire again, but something felt wrong. Instead of heat, I felt a strange, heavy pressure beneath my feet. The air around me shifted, and the rocks at my feet began to tremble, rising slowly into the air. I gasped as they started spinning, whirling faster and faster, pulled into a chaotic orbit around me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Come on… work!" I muttered, trying to regain control. But it was like the magic had a mind of its own, tapping into something deeper than just fire. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The rocks spun violently, obeying this wild energy, and I could feel the power spiraling out of control. With a desperate shove, I sent the rocks flying into the air, crashing them back down onto the bridge.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The impact was far more powerful than I'd intended. The stones slammed into the surface, shattering the bridge as deep cracks rapidly spread outward, racing toward me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c6">Yes, it worked!</span><span class="c5"> I thought, but my relief quickly turned to panic. </span><span class="c5 c6">Shoot</span><span class="c5 c6">, it worked too well!</span><span class="c2"> The entire structure was falling apart beneath me. I turned and ran, the sound of collapsing stone thundering behind me, as the monsters chasing us plummeted into the pit below.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I kept running, boots slamming against ancient stone as the bridge cracked and crumbled behind me. The deafening sound of grinding rock echoed through the chasm, each slab breaking loose and plunging into the void below. Dust exploded around my feet, and I could feel the very earth disintegrating beneath me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Crap! Come on!” I shouted, forcing myself to move faster, even as the ground trembled with every collapsing section. My breath came in ragged bursts, lungs burning, panic pounding in my chest. The far ledge was in sight—but the bridge was vanishing behind me, catching up too fast.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">“</span><span class="c5 c6">Hurry!</span><span class="c2">” Bluma's voice rang out above the chaos. She stood at the edge, one arm outstretched, her four eyes wide with alarm. Her fingers reached for mine, desperate and sure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I launched myself forward with every last ounce of strength I had. The final chunk of stone crumbled beneath my foot mid-jump, sending a jolt through my body. My fingers stretched out, straining for hers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">For a heartbeat, I thought I had it—thought I was safe.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">But I missed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">My hand swung through open air, and my stomach lurched. Gravity took me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“No—no—no—!” The sickening drop tore a scream from my throat as I fell.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Deta!” Beans and Gwen shouted in unison, their voices jagged with panic. I caught a glimpse of their terrified faces peering over the edge, the wind whipping their hair as dust swirled around them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">“</span><span class="c5 c6">Deta!</span><span class="c2">” Beans cried again—but then his expression changed. His eyes widened in sudden hope.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I threw out my hand mid-fall, summoning vines in a panic. They burst from the stone walls with a crack and a hiss, wrapping tight around me just before I hit bottom. The impact yanked the air from my lungs, but I was safe—dangling in a cocoon of green, suspended just above the jagged rocks below.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"I'm alright!" I called up, voice shaky but alive. "Though I could really use some help getting up…” I added with a nervous chuckle, eyeing the vines with uncertainty. They creaked ominously under my weight, leaves fluttering in the updraft.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Above, I saw movement as Gwen and Beans scrambled into action.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">And I tried very hard not to look down again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Gwen smiled down at me. "That was so dumb, Bushy,"  she then pulled out a rope and lowered it down. After several minutes of tugging and effort, they finally managed to pull me back up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Thanks, guys," I said, catching my breath, grateful to be back on solid ground. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans clapped me on the back with a jump, his relief evident. "We're glad you're okay, Deta," he said with a smile. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I smiled back. "Me too, let's figure out how to get out of here."</span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c5 c8 c6 c14"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16 c8 c6 c14">Gwen’s View</span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c5 c8 c6 c14"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Bluma and Deta took the lead, their footsteps echoing softly against the damp stone, while I hung back, keeping to the rear. Beans walked somewhere in between, casting glances over his shoulder. He must've noticed the way I held my arms tightly to myself, or the way my eyes kept darting to every shadowed corner.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">He slowed his pace until he was beside me. “Hey… what’s wrong?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I didn’t look at him for long—just a brief flicker of eye contact before I turned away, pulse quickening with that awful, creeping tightness in my chest. The kind that made it hard to breathe, like the air itself didn’t want me here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans sighed. “Gwen, if something’s on your mind, speak it. If not, then quit acting rude.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I exhaled hard, not quite ready to talk but knowing he wouldn’t drop it. My voice came out quieter than I meant. “I just… have bad memories here.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">His expression changed—eyes searching my face, some of the frustration fading. “Wait, you’ve been in the Underworld before?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I nodded slowly. The stone corridors around us seemed to close in tighter with every step. “Yeah. Multiple times. Since I was really young…”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I hugged myself, the cave walls starting to blur at the edges. My feet kept moving, but everything in me wanted to turn and run the other way.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans fell silent, his gaze softening, but he didn’t press for more. I was thankful for that. I didn’t want to unravel. Not now. Not here. I kept walking in silence, staring ahead, the only sound the distant echo of dripping water and a far-off growl that made my stomach twist.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“...Well,” Beans murmured, “you’re not anymore.” He offered a small, lopsided smile before drifting back to walk beside Bluma.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I watched him go, the echo of his words settling deep in my chest, though the unease still clawed at me. The air down here carried something heavy, something ancient and cruel. Each gust from the tunnels brought with it memories I didn’t want. Memories I didn’t speak of.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">A low roar rumbled in the distance. I tensed. Every sound bounced too long, like the place was alive and listening. “I just want to stay safe and as far from here as possible,” I muttered under my breath.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Distracted, I walked straight into Bluma’s back. She glanced at me, her expression unreadable, then turned forward again. The group had stopped. I shifted to the side to see why.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Up ahead, pale blue lights floated like slow-moving fireflies in the dark.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“What are those?” Deta asked quietly, his voice edged with wariness.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“They’re fufus,” I answered, stepping a little closer before realizing I’d instinctively moved ahead of the group.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Fufus?” he repeated.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans cocked his head. “What are those?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I glanced back at them, managing a faint smile. “Fufus are the only nice things down here.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As I spoke, the lights responded—softening in color and drifting toward us, like they understood. One of them settled on my outstretched hand: a small, furred creature, weightless and warm. Its two eyes blinked up at me as its coat shimmered between soft hues of blue and green.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The gentle presence of the fufu eased something inside me. Not enough to erase the memories—but enough to let me breathe.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Deta laughed quietly, stretching out his hand. “Aw, they’re adorable.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Another fufu landed there, curling into his palm as he stroked its downy fur.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“They’re drawn to mental energy,” I explained, still watching the one on my hand. “That’s their food source.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans, wide-eyed, immediately took a step back and covered his head. “I don’t need a fufu eating my brain!”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I laughed—an actual laugh—and shook my head. “Not like that, Dwarf. They duplicate your thoughts and memories, then eat the copies.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The fufu on my hand blinked slowly, then pressed its tiny head against my thumb, as if offering comfort. I stroked its back, my voice softer now. “They’re harmless.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">For the first time since we arrived, the air didn’t feel quite so heavy.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16 c6 c17">Deta’s View</span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Suddenly, the </span><span class="c3">fufus</span><span class="c0"> turned purple and floated away. Bluma, Beans, and I smiled as the fufus departed. Beans softly admitted, "I guess they are kind of cute," which elicited chuckles from Bluma and me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When I turned to look at Gwen, however, I noticed that she was trembling, her sword at the ready, although the blade seemed much smaller than usual. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Gwen?" Bluma called out, also puzzled by her behavior, but she didn't respond. I approached her to speak, but the words shriveled on my tongue.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the darkness ahead, a massive, luminous green eye hovered in the void—unnaturally still, unblinking, and far too focused. It watched us with a predator’s patience, dissecting our movements like a butcher deciding where to make the first cut.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then came the voice—low and rotted, as if it clawed its way through gravel and rust. "Why... hello... there."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The ground quivered beneath my feet. A root snapped free from the stone and coiled up my wrist, growing bark as it hardened into my staff. The wood throbbed with a sickly green pulse as I fed it magic. My grip tightened around the shaft, bark groaning under the strain. I leveled it forward. “Who are you?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"My name... does not matter... You four... seem lost, yes?" the creature croaked, each syllable caught between a wheeze and a chuckle. It turned its attention to Beans and Bluma, its eye narrowing like a tightening noose. "I can... help... guide you in the right direction..." It coughed—wet, phlegmy, as though it was trying to clear tar from its lungs.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen shook her head. She didn’t speak, but her jaw locked and her stance grew tense.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then the creature stepped into view.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Its body was man-sized, but everything about it was wrong. Its skin resembled stretched wax—pale, semi-translucent, and strung over twitching sinew. One enormous eye, veined and slightly glowing, dominated its head, while a grin of needle-thin teeth split its lower face. Spikes jutted from its back at uneven angles, echoing the jagged stalagmites above. Each time it moved, it made a wet clicking noise, like joints too long dry now grinding together.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Its gaze fixed on Gwen. "You seem... familiar..."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bluma unsheathed her sword in a single motion. Beans’s voice cut through the tension. "What is it you want from us?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I stepped in front of Gwen. The air grew colder.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The creature hissed as I moved. "Hm... I seek magic... Give me your glowing staff, boy..."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Its fingers curled as it reached forward—long, knotted digits tipped with blackened claws that gleamed wet in the cavern’s dim glow. I yanked the staff back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"And why should I?" I asked. The air between us was thick with damp, moldy breath.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It didn’t blink—maybe it couldn’t. "Give me the staff imbued with magic, and I will tell you where you can find a way out... Does that sound fair, boy?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It stretched its arms wide, talons catching the little light there was, and opened its fists—revealing claws sharper than any blade. My pulse thudded behind my ears. “If I give you my staff, will you tell us how to leave?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The creature nodded too quickly, its body jittering with anticipation. "Yes, yes... I told you. Now give me your staff!!!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It lunged, but Gwen moved faster. Her sword kissed the creature’s throat with a metallic whisper. It froze, that single eye twitching in its socket.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Directions first, then the staff," Gwen snapped, though I saw the tremble in her sword arm.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The creature gurgled something foul and pulled back slightly, claws flexing in frustration. "Fine." It pointed a crooked, clawed finger northward. "Go through the Shroom Jungle to the Crystal Plains... You'll find someone who knows a way out..."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beans stepped forward, skeptical. “I thought you were going to tell us how to get out of here.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The creature turned its head sharply, vertebrae cracking audibly as it hissed, “I am!... to the best of my… abilities!!” It coughed again—harder this time, spattering something dark onto the stone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen and I locked eyes. She shook her head. I frowned and murmured, “It’s better than nothing.” Then I turned to face the creature. I forced a smile. “Thank you. And a deal is a deal.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I handed it the staff.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The light inside died the moment it touched its warped hands—but it didn’t notice. With a shrill, delighted screech, the creature darted backward into the shadows, limbs bending at wrong angles as it vanished.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And just like that, we were moving too—fast, silent, and not daring to look back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Well, that was creepy," Beans remarked, a sentiment I shared. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Yeah, I'm just glad we have some directions now," I responded. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We then heard a contorted scream. Gwen's face turned pale, and she held her sword shakily. Bluma unsheathed her sword, and Beans gripped his ax tightly. I  tried to reach for my staff, only to remember that it was no longer in my possession. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Shoot." I muttered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bluma immediately whispered loudly, "Hide!" and we dispersed, taking cover behind nearby stalagmites. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Soon enough, we heard the creature approaching, raging about being tricked “You can't hide from me magic user! I will tear you apart and feast on your friends' bones!”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We recognized it as the same creature from earlier. As it ran past us, consumed by revenge, we remained hidden until it was at a safe distance, and then cautiously emerged.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"What did you do?!" Beans whispered angered and bewildered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">"I just gave him my </span><span class="c3">staff</span><span class="c0">!" I replied, equally perplexed and shocked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beans and I started arguing while trying to stay quiet, but before it escalated further, Bluma smacked both of our heads. "Enough," she scolded us in a hushed tone. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We then decided to alter our path, deviating from our original plan, hoping to lose the pursuing creature. Bluma and Beans took the lead, though Beans was still visibly upset. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Angry..?" Bluma commented, surprised by his lingering frustration. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beans' words drifted toward me as I walked beside Gwen. "Well, now we have a monster chasing us because of him! We don’t know how strong it is, and—" He trailed off as Bluma suddenly halted, crouching down and placing a hand on his shoulder. The silent exchange passed between them, and Beans gave a reluctant nod.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I couldn’t quite make out the words, but the heavy silence that followed was enough. My stomach twisted. I wanted to turn and speak, to say something, but I couldn’t bring myself to.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When Bluma straightened and resumed walking, Beans let out a long sigh, then began to approach me. His footsteps were hesitant, and I couldn’t help but feel the weight of his impending apology.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Hey, Deta," he greeted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I turned to face him, smiling. "Oh, hey, Beans. Something wrong?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He returned the smile and said, "Well... I wanted to apologize. I didn’t mean to get so angry at you back there."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I smiled, giving it some thought, and replied, "No worries. We're in a dangerous place, so it's only natural to feel agitated."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beans chuckled and teased, "Are you calling me scared?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I responded playfully, "Maybe."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We both chuckled before he went back to join Bluma.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"I think that went well," I chuckled to myself, then looked at Gwen, who had a smile on her face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"You two are so weird," she commented, picking up her pace. I was left bewildered, unable to comprehend her statement. As we continued walking, rocks suddenly began pelting down from above.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Watch out!" I shouted, barely dodging a falling stalactite in time. "That was close..." I breathed a sigh of relief and turned to check on the others, only to see tentacles sprouting from the creature’s sides and a giant red eye appearing. It scanned its surroundings and, upon spotting us, lifted itself off the ground, reaching out with its tentacles to grab me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Bluma rushed over with her sword, parrying the creature's tentacles and managing to slice one off. However, the severed tentacle quickly regenerated, and the creature let out a fierce roar. It was massive, reminiscent of the creatures we had encountered when we first entered this underground realm.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Run!" Bluma commanded, continuing to fight off the tentacles. Gwen immediately took off, but Beans stayed behind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Deta! Make sure she doesn’t do something stupid! I’ll stay and help Bluma!" he shouted. I nodded and sprinted after Gwen.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16 c8 c6 c14">Gwen’s View</span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c5 c8 c6 c14"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Gwen! Wait up!” Deta’s voice echoed behind me, but I couldn’t stop, my heart pounding in my chest. I ran, my thoughts a blur, until Deta finally caught up, grabbing my arm. I jerked back instinctively, desperate to break free.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Let me go!” I shouted, twisting in his grip until I saw his face. My muscles tensed, my breath coming in sharp bursts.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Gwen…?” he said, voice softer now. I turned away, ready to flee, but he moved in front of me, blocking my escape. “What’s going on? You’ve been off ever since we got down here.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I kept my eyes fixed on the ground, a knot tightening in my stomach. “Why do you care? I’m not going to be your prisoner,” I muttered, the words cutting through the tense air. His face twisted in shock.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Do you really think I’d make you a prisoner?” Deta’s voice softened, confusion laced in his tone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I glanced at him, still suspicious, still guarded. “Why else are you being nice? You’re just setting me up for a trap,” I said, taking a step back, determined to get away.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Gwen...” Deta followed, his voice steady but laced with concern. “I would never make you a prisoner. None of us would! We need to go back and help Bluma. She’s our friend—”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Your friend!” I spun on him, my anger flaring. “She doesn’t care about me, and you know it!” The words lashed out, raw and full of hurt. I watched the sting register on his face before I turned away, my footsteps heavy as I tried to distance myself from him and the doubt clouding my mind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Before I could make sense of anything, a shadow lunged from behind, its cold, scaly hands like iron bands around my throat. I gasped, feeling its claws dig into my skin, the rancid stench of decay flooding my senses. Its breath was thick with rot, a sour, fetid odor that made my stomach churn as it growled in my ear.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The creature’s voice was a low, guttural rasp, the kind that scraped at my soul. “Now I have dinner! And nothing you do can save her!” it hissed, its single glowing eye gleaming with a hungry, sickening light.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I kicked, thrashing against its grip, but its claws tightened, choking the air from my lungs. My vision blurred as I fought, my chest aching for a breath.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Just as darkness began to take over, a burst of fire streaked across my vision, crashing into the creature’s side. It howled in pain, releasing me as flames danced over its scaly skin.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Don’t you dare hurt my friend!” Deta’s voice rang out, fierce and unyielding.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The creature snarled, its twisted form rippling as it turned toward Deta. Its long, spindly limbs coiled like a serpent ready to strike. Jagged, yellow teeth gleamed in the dim light, and its skin, slick and almost liquid in appearance, shifted as it moved.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As it lunged, its claws were mere inches from Deta’s throat. My fingers gripped my sword on their own, the warmth of its magic pulsing through me. The blade shimmered, lighter than air, as if it was part of me, an extension of my will. Fear ebbed away, replaced by cold focus.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">In one fluid motion, I swung the sword. The metal cut through the air, and the creature’s head rolled from its shoulders with a sickening thud. Its body crumpled to the ground at my feet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Deta stood frozen, his mouth slightly open in shock. My pulse hammered in my ears, but for the first time in what felt like forever, I allowed myself to smile—genuine and triumphant.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Fine,” I said, glancing over my shoulder toward where Bluma was, still in danger, trying not to look at the blood. “Let’s go help that demon,” I added, gripping my sword with newfound confidence. The weight of my earlier fear seemed to vanish as I felt my connection to the sword, to the fight, solidify within me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Deta’s grin spread wide, lighting his face. “There’s Gwen!” he said with a laugh, shaking his head.</span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16 c8 c6 c14">Beans’ View</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c5 c8 c6 c14"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Bluma struggled to close the distance to the beast, every attempt blocked by a tentacle whipping her away. The monster was relentless, its slimy limbs striking with precision and force. I gritted my teeth, fury boiling in my chest as I saw her stumble back again. This thing wasn’t going to stop unless we made it stop.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I gripped my ax tightly and hurled it with all my strength. The blade spun through the air and buried itself deep into the creature’s eye. A shriek of pain tore from its throat, a high-pitched wail that made the ground tremble under my boots.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The monster thrashed wildly, blinded, its tentacles flailing in every direction. I dodged one as it came crashing down beside me, but Bluma wasn’t as lucky. The beast’s massive arm coiled around her, squeezing her tightly. Her body contorted in pain, and I could see her strength fading fast as the creature began to drain her life force.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I didn’t think. I just moved.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Charging forward, I leaped onto the creature’s side, yanking my ax from its ruined eye with a sickening squelch. Blood and ooze splattered everywhere. With a roar, I brought the ax down again, splitting the tentacle holding Bluma. She fell to the ground, limp but alive.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The creature bellowed in agony, but there was no time to celebrate. Its remaining three tentacles lashed out at me with deadly speed. I barely raised my ax in time to block, but the force nearly knocked me off my feet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Before I could react, Gwen darted in, her colossal sword swinging in a blur. With a mighty sweep, she severed all three tentacles in one clean strike. The sound of the severed limbs hitting the ground was like thunder.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Deta!" I called over my shoulder, eyes locked on Bluma, who lay pale and unmoving.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Deta, always quick on his feet, sprinted to her side. I saw the glow of his magic as he knelt beside her, healing her wounds. His face was a mask of focus, lips moving in quiet incantation. Slowly, color returned to Bluma’s cheeks, and she opened her eyes. With Deta’s help, she got to her feet, her strength renewed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">She nodded gratefully to him before rushing back into the fight. The beast’s tentacles had already begun to regenerate, sprouting from the stumps where Gwen had cut them. I growled in frustration. This thing just wouldn’t die.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Bluma and Gwen moved in sync, hacking away at the tentacles as fast as they could grow back. I could see their frustration building. No matter how many limbs they severed, the creature just kept regenerating.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Everyone, move!" Deta's voice rang out, sharp and commanding.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I glanced back to see him standing tall, hands outstretched as three glowing fireballs spun in the air above him. With a flick of his wrists, he sent them hurtling toward the creature. They struck with a blinding flash of light, and the beast let out an agonized scream that echoed across the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Seizing the moment, I sprinted forward. This was our chance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">With all the strength I could muster, I drove my ax deep into the monster’s remaining eye, the blade sinking into its skull with a satisfying crunch. The creature let out one final, ear-piercing shriek before collapsing in a heap, lifeless.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I stepped back, panting, blood and sweat mixing on my skin. My heart was still pounding in my chest, but the battlefield was finally silent. The creature lay still, its massive body crumpled on the ground.</span></p><hr/><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><h5 class="c7 c23" id="h.35nkun2"><span class="c21">CHAPTER 13</span><span class="c13 c8">                                                                                                                                   A Light in the Depths</span></h5><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Gwen wore a smile until her gaze landed on the blood clinging to her sword. The color drained from her face. She staggered back a step, then turned away and vomited.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I moved toward her instinctively, taking the sword from her shaking hands. My chest tightened. I hated seeing her like that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans looked bewildered. “Is she okay?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I nodded, though my voice was quieter than usual. “She’ll be fine.” I glanced at Gwen, who was wiping her mouth on her arm, still pale. “She despises blood.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans furrowed his brow and looked at Bluma. “A fighter who hates blood? Isn’t that... unusual?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Bluma gave a short, hesitant nod. “Strange.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Gwen took a deep breath, straightened up, and forced a grin. “Alright, let’s head to the jungle!” She patted Bluma on the back as she passed, like nothing had happened.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans hesitated, clearly unsure how to react. Bluma followed slowly, casting one last glance at Gwen. I walked behind her, watching her carefully. The others couldn’t see it, but I could tell—her hands were still trembling.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">None of us spoke for a while. The silence stretched between us as we made our way forward, each step carrying the weight of what had just happened.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Eventually, the rocky cavern floor gave way to softer ground. Faintly glowing mushrooms began to scatter across the path, their gentle light painting the earth in shades of blue and green. They clustered like a tiny, glowing garden.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans let out a soft chuckle, the tension in his voice easing. “This is the jungle? A little disappointing”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I smiled and tilted my head upward. “Look up.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">He did—and stopped in his tracks. Towering mushrooms loomed overhead, their caps glowing like lanterns in the dark. Vines draped between them, and glowing spores drifted lazily through the air, lighting the space like tiny stars.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Oh... this is the jungle," Beans muttered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"It's breathtaking," I said, marveling at the sight.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Bluma, captivated, nodded.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">After a few minutes, we pressed forward, venturing deeper into the jungle. The soft glow of mushrooms lit our path, and the air grew still—almost too still.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Then Beans slowed, his boots making a soft splash. He looked down and stiffened.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Uh, Gwen," he said carefully. "Don’t look down."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">We all followed his gaze. Blood. A shallow pool of it shimmered beneath the glowing spores, so thin and still that it had gone unnoticed—until now. Gwen stumbled back, hand over her mouth, eyes wide.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Bluma knelt, touched the edge. "Fresh."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans looked toward the slope beside the path. His voice was low, but urgent. “There’s someone down there.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">My stomach turned. I stepped forward, heart pounding. “We have to check,” I said, already moving in the direction he pointed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">At the bottom of the hill, we spotted a figure lying in the underbrush, half-covered in dirt and blood. My heart stopped for a moment. It wasn’t Rinn—but the resemblance was too close. The same messy straight white hair, the way his clothes clung to his slender frame. Gwen, standing behind me, breathed deeply, almost a growl. She must’ve noticed it too.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The man's legs were broken—twisted, arms weak and almost unable to pull himself across the ground. Blood poured from his wounds. His voice was faint, but full of desperation. "I can’t die here. I can’t..."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I stepped forward to help him, but Bluma raised a hand in front of me, stopping me. Confused, I followed her gaze to a bush behind the injured man.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">We crouched low. From the bushes emerged a massive, dog-like creature with eight eyes and a tentacled tail, spikes gleaming at the tip. Five more followed. The man—so like Rinn—sensed their approach and turned, panic flooding his eyes. His lips moved, but no sound came out at first. Then, in a hoarse whisper, he cried out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"No! No, please! Go away!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">His pleas went unanswered as the creatures pounced, ripping him apart. Gwen turned away, unable to watch, while I covered my ears to block out his screams. In moments, his lifeless body lay still. A few of the creatures grabbed him with their tails and dragged him into the underbrush.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">We remained silent, the heavy air pressing around us, until the ground beneath our feet shifted. Then we rose—only to lock eyes with one of the creatures, its gaze piercing through the shadows.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The stench of damp earth mixed with something rotten, and the creature's massive form loomed just beyond the reach of the dim glow, its skin a mottled blend of dark green and gray. The heavy, pulsating thud of its breath echoed in the stillness, and its yellow eyes gleamed like fireflies in the dark.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Startled, we jumped back, the sharp scrape of metal against stone as we unsheathed our weapons. The creature’s low growl vibrated through the ground, and its jagged, gnarled teeth glinted in the eerie light, daring us to make a move. We stood frozen, weapons at the ready, senses screaming as the tension thickened in the air.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Careful," Bluma whispered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Obviously," Gwen muttered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As the dog-like creature edged closer, its heavy paws making the softest crunch on the moss-covered ground, a thunderous roar suddenly shattered the stillness from our left. The air seemed to vibrate with the force of it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The creature froze mid-step, its nostrils flaring as its yellow eyes darted toward the source of the sound. Before any of us could react, a massive, hairless, purple tiger with four gleaming eyes erupted from the underbrush. Its massive claws dug into the earth with a sound like tearing fabric, and its fur-less skin glistened in the dim light, sending waves of tension through the air.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The dog-like creature didn’t hesitate. It bolted, its frantic footfalls pounding the earth as it vanished into the thick jungle.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c2">The purple tiger gave a final, guttural growl, watching for a moment before it too disappeared into the shadows, leaving the jungle as quiet as it had been moments before. The air, still thick with adrenaline, pressed in on us, and our weapons remained poised, though nothing else came.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Are you all alright?" a voice called out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">We turned, startled, as a man in a cloak—its dark fabric almost blending with the surrounding shadows—stepped from the underbrush. His cloak was speckled with mushrooms, their pale caps catching the faint glow of the jungle light. "Those Halusanines almost had you," he said with a grin, his voice smooth but laced with something mocking. "Glad I was patrolling nearby."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">He smirked, catching sight of our drawn weapons. "Relax, kittens. I’m not here to harm you. Name’s Flevoka."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I raised an eyebrow, the tension still humming in the air. "Flevoka?" I asked, folding my arms, my gaze steady. "That’s a Randeth name for a girl…"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">His grin faltered for just a heartbeat, but it was enough. "Randeth?" he repeated, his voice forced, the hint of discomfort slipping through. He quickly tried to laugh it off. "Nah, call me Adam."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I didn't buy it. There was something in his eyes—something behind the forced smile. The hesitation was obvious, and judging by the way Bluma’s four eyes narrowed in suspicion, she saw it too. Whatever game he was playing, it was unraveling faster than he could keep up with.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Gwen, always impatient, sheathed her sword with a sharp, practiced motion. "Enough with the chit-chat. Let’s keep moving."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Adam chuckled, but the sound was tight. "Impatient, huh? Well, if you’re looking for civilization, follow me—or stay and see if those Halusanines come back for round two."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Gwen shot me a glance, one that suggested her patience was already worn thin. I shrugged. "Better than dealing with those dog creatures."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The air around us felt thick with uncertainty, but with no other options, we followed him into the jungle, wary but with no choice but to trust him—at least for now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">We followed Adam through the dense jungle, the air growing warmer with each step as we neared a small camp. The crackle of a fire reached our ears, and the faint scent of roasting meat mixed with the earthy aroma of damp moss.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As we entered the clearing, the sight of several dead Halusanines greeted us. Their bodies were bound and sprawled out carelessly, the dull, twisted forms of their limbs giving off a faint, unpleasant odor of decay. One of them hung skewered over a blue fire, its flesh sizzling and spitting as the flames danced around it, casting eerie shadows on the surrounding trees. The heat from the fire made the air shimmer slightly, and the strange blue hue gave everything a surreal, unnatural quality.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The silence of the camp was thick, broken only by the crackle of the fire and the occasional rustle of leaves in the wind. It felt wrong—too still, too empty, but Adam seemed at ease, walking up to a nearby log and sitting down as if this were an everyday occurrence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Welcome to the Trapper’s Camp," Adam said, other half-elves emerging from their tents. The camp, perched near a cliff, offered a view of the jungle below. He then asked Gwen to help move the Halusanine that was just brought in and with some convincing she went to help.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Bluma took in the sight of various mushrooms the trappers had harvested. Beans studied them too. </span><span class="c0">"I don't like this... we need to leave the underworld as soon as possible," Beans expressed his concerns as we observed some trappers dismembering Halusanine. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"I agree... let's find Gwen and see if we can find any information to guide us in the right direction," I responded quietly, not wanting to attract attention. Beans and Bluma nodded in agreement and left, while I set off to locate Gwen. As I walked, I spotted her near the pile of Halusanine, placing something into her bag.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Gwen," I whispered with urgency, causing her to jump.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"What?" she snapped, irritated by the sudden shock.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"We're planning to leave," I informed her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Hearing this, she grinned and exclaimed, "Finally! Let's get moving!" I sighed, though a smile crept across my face. "Bluma and Beans are searching for any clues to guide us," I added. Gwen groaned in response. "Alright, let's start searching."</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16 c8 c6 c14">Beans’ View</span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c5 c8 c6 c14"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Bluma and I wandered through the camp, the humid air thick with the musk of rotting foliage and ash. Each tent we searched smelled like mildew and old sweat, filled with the clutter of supplies stacked carelessly—half-melted wax candles, chipped blades, bags of grain chewed open by vermin. The ground squelched faintly beneath our boots, soft with damp moss and spilled food.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Most of what we found was basic—cracked bowls, rusted weapons, threadbare blankets. I sifted through another crate of useless odds and ends, the wood rough beneath my fingers, splinters biting at my skin. Stepping out of the tent, I let out a sharp sigh, the air catching in my dry throat. "Nothing useful in there," I muttered, my frustration rising like heat off the fire pits.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Bluma, eyes always scanning, paused. She raised her hand, her four-eyed gaze fixed on something further out. “Beans,” she said, her voice low and steady, motioning toward a large tent that sat isolated on the camp’s edge, close to the tree line and far from the cliffs.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I followed her gesture. The tent was larger than the others, its canvas taut and darkened from age and use. “Worth a look,” I agreed. “Let’s go.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">We padded through the underbrush, trying not to disturb the brittle twigs and dead leaves underfoot. But before we could get close, I saw them—massive, hairless tiger-like beasts sprawled across the sun-warmed earth. Their purple skin shimmered faintly, almost oily in the light, and their four eyes blinked slowly even in sleep. Each exhale made their bellies rise and fall like bellows, and the rumble of their snoring rolled through the air like distant thunder.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I stopped short and threw out a hand to halt Bluma. My heart slammed against my ribs, and my stomach seized with panic. I leaned in, barely breathing. "We need to go around. We can't risk waking those giant cats."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Bluma simply nodded, her expression unreadable as always. Together, we began to circle wide, our movements slow and deliberate. The jungle felt heavier here, dense with moisture and tension. That’s when I spotted it—a slit torn into the back of the tent, just large enough for someone my size to squeeze through.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I turned to her, managing a nervous smile. "Alright, I’ll be right back," I whispered, though my voice quivered slightly. With one last look at the sleeping beasts, I slid inside.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The fabric rasped against my skin as I squeezed through. The air inside was thick and musty, and the dimness made everything feel close and oppressive. My stomach twisted with nervous energy, a familiar and unwanted pressure beginning to build deep in my gut.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The tent was cluttered with clothing—mounds of it. Damp shirts clung together, stained trousers lay folded with disturbing neatness, and something sour hung in the air like mold and sweat mixed with unwashed bodies. I dug through the piles, trying to ignore the wave of nausea rising in me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Great. Waist-deep in laundry, I thought bitterly, suppressing a gag.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Then—footsteps. Heavy. Confident. My pulse spiked, and the pressure in my gut surged. Panic clawed at me as I looked around, eyes landing on a large crate. Without thinking, I dove inside, the edges bruising my shins. I yanked a heap of scratchy clothes over myself, forcing my breath to slow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Three men entered, their boots thudding against the packed dirt floor. Their voices carried a harsh rhythm in a language I didn’t know. Trappers. One of them snorted a laugh, and I caught a few words as they slipped into Common.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“The captain’s going to be in for a surprise when he sees what we’ve brought back. Ain’t nobody expecting this kind of haul.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“True. But I don’t think we’re done yet. There’s still that group hiding out in the woods. Think they’ll be worth the trouble?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Who cares?” another scoffed. “As long as we bring them in, the boss’ll be happy. Heard one of ’em’s got a bounty. Could be worth a fortune.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">My stomach clenched. Us. They were talking about us. I pressed my back into the side of the crate, every muscle rigid. The pressure inside was unbearable now. My mouth went dry as I tried not to move, not to breathe too loudly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Yeah, let’s round them up. Easy money,” the first one said, his voice too close for comfort.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">They lingered, laughing and tossing out crude jokes, their boots scraping on the floorboards. Every second dragged like wet cloth over stone. I couldn’t hold it in much longer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Come on. Leave already, I begged in silence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">At last, the voices began to fade. I stayed still, counting each second. Then—pfft. The tiny, betraying noise escaped me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c6">Not now</span><span class="c2">, I groaned inwardly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Another reason why I hate elves," I muttered under my breath, climbing out of the crate. The pile of clothing reeked—sour body odor, blood, and something like fermented fish. I gagged and waved a hand in front of my face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">That’s when I saw the room at the back of the tent. Something about it pulled me forward. The air shifted as I stepped through the threshold—cooler, quieter. A wide table stood in the center, surrounded by mismatched chairs. Spread across it was a massive map of the Underworld, drawn in precise ink strokes and marked with strange symbols.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Wow…” I breathed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I moved closer, the parchment smooth beneath my fingers. At the far end, a tightly rolled scroll caught my eye. I reached for it—then froze. Voices again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Dread settled in my chest like a stone as I dove under the table. Two sets of footsteps entered the room, then halted nearby.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“After we lead them to the slave traders, we’ll get quite the reward, right?” one said, snickering.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Indeed. But first, we need to make sure they trust us. Right, Adam?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Adam. My throat tightened.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">He was working with them. I knew it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I balled my fists under the table. I wanted to leap out and scream, but I forced myself still. One of the trappers turned back, and Adam's voice called from just outside: “Bring me the rolled-up map.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The man plucked it off the table. I silently cursed, watching my only lead disappear through the canvas flap.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I waited, listening. Adam’s voice echoed as he chatted with someone just outside the tent. The scroll had been set on a crate, barely five feet away.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">This was my chance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I crept from beneath the table, moving slowly, deliberately, knees trembling with each shift of weight. My breath came in shallow bursts. That internal pressure pulsed like a second heartbeat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Not now, Beans. Almost there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I reached out, fingers brushing the parchment. Then Adam’s silhouette shifted, his head turning slightly. I yanked the scroll back and dove into another crate, my legs cramping up as I curled in tight.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Sweat dripped from my brow, soaking into my collar. I clutched the scroll to my chest like it could shield me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I need to leave… I need to leave…</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Eventually, the voices faded again. I didn’t wait this time. Bursting from the crate, I shoved through the tent’s slit and stumbled into the fresh air, drawing in a gasping breath. My body sagged as the tension bled out of me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Bluma stood there, calm as always. She tilted her head, one brow lifting at my ragged state.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c2">“Good?” she asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Yeah, just... stress,” I muttered, wiping my forehead. “But I got the scroll.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">She gave a single nod. “Good.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">We spread the parchment between us on a flat rock. It was a map, sketched in fine lines, showing a crystalline structure labeled </span><span class="c5 c6">Temple</span><span class="c2"> to the northeast. A city sprawled to the northwest.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Well, we’ve got our map,” I said, a tremor still in my voice. But a grin tugged at the edge of my lips. "Let's go find Gwen and Deta."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Bluma nodded again. “Right.”</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16 c8 c6 c14">Deta’s View</span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c5 c8 c6 c14"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Roughly twenty minutes passed before we all met up again. Beans was the first to speak, eyeing us with curiosity. “Did you two find anything?” Gwen shook her head “Nothing but junk” She groaned. ‘What did you two lovebirds find?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans and Bluma turned red when Gwen called them "lovebirds."Beans cleared his throat. "We found a map," he said. "It shows a path to some kind of Temple." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Gwen immediately wanted to see it, and Beans handed it over. After studying it she almost threw it back to him “We are not going to that temple…”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">This left us puzzled, as going through the temple seemed like the quicker option. Before I could ask, Gwen cut me off, insisting we avoid the temple. She rolled up the map and stashed it in her pouch. "Just trust me on that… Let’s head to the city" she said, turning to leave. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">At that moment, Adam appeared in front of Gwen, disappointment evident on his face. "Leaving already? Too bad. We were going to help you get home," he sneered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Gwen reacted first, her hand flying to her sword. Tension snapped through the air like a drawn wire.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Adam’s grin widened—not with surprise, but satisfaction. He’d been waiting for this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Before any of us could speak, he lunged, twisting through the air like a serpent, his curved dagger gleaming in the dim light. Every strike was deliberate, rehearsed—he wasn’t fighting to win. He was fighting to enjoy it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Gwen barely dodged the first blow, the blade hissing past her armor with a sharp </span><span class="c5 c6">scrape</span><span class="c2">. Bluma met the second with her sword, the clash rattling up her arms. Beans caught the third with his ax, the impact bursting into a flash of sparks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Before Adam could press his advantage, I seized the moment and swung the staff with all my strength. Magic pulsed through it, glowing with a green and blue aura as it struck Adam’s side. The power hurled him into the air, but instead of being stunned, he twisted mid-flight, landing on his feet with the grace of a predator. He grimaced, clutching his ribs, but the fight in his eyes burned brighter than ever.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">He moved again, this time with greater speed. His movements carried more caution, weaving between us like a shadow. He lunged at Bluma, forcing her back against a jagged boulder, while Gwen swung her massive sword, aiming to cut him down. Adam ducked under the blade, escaping, and swept his leg at Gwen’s knees, causing her to lose her balance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">With a roar, Beans charged, his ax raised high. Adam, swift as ever, flicked a hidden knife from his wrist. It whizzed through the air, cutting Beans' cheek, leaving a thin line of blood. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"You’re too slow," Adam spat, a smirk creeping across his face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Refusing to back down, I rushed in. I swinging the glowing stick once more, targeting Adam’s chest, but he anticipated my move. Sidestepping, he grabbed my arm and threw me to the ground. The stick slipped from my grasp, rolling just out of reach.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Gwen, Bluma, and Beans quickly closed in, forming a tight circle around him. Adam’s eyes darted between us, calculating his next move with precision. There was no room for hesitation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Bluma feigned left, then lunged at his right side, while Gwen’s sword descended in a powerful arc. Adam twisted out of the way, using his dagger to deflect Bluma’s strike, but Gwen’s sword cut into his shoulder. He winced, blood staining his leather armor, yet his determination never wavered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Just as Adam prepared for another attack, I scrambled to retrieve the stick. With a sudden swing, I caught him off guard. The force sent him flying once more, this time skidding closer to the edge of the cliff. He slammed into the ground, his body sliding across the rough surface.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Panting, Adam shoved himself upright, blood smeared at the corner of his mouth. His eyes burned—not with fear, but with something darker. Delight.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">He spat to the side and sneered, “That it? Come on. I expected more from the ones screwing up my plans.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">His dagger twitched in his hand, eager for another round.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The ground trembled beneath him as he staggered toward the cliff’s edge, the rocks shifting under his weight. Gwen advanced, her sword raised, but before she could strike, Adam lunged at me with one last desperate effort. I swung the stick again, this time connecting squarely with his chest. The magic surged through him, launching him backward.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">He hit the ground hard, his momentum carrying him to the edge. With one final misstep, the earth crumbled beneath his feet, sending him plummeting into the abyss. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I watched as Adam plummeted to the ground in silence and couldn't help but feel a twinge of guilt. Gwen noticed my expression and reassured me, "Don't feel bad. He attacked first. Now let's get out of here… his friends probably heard the fight” We followed Gwen and sneaked out of the Trapper camp. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As we ventured through the jungle, I played with the magical stick I had acquired, realizing its power to send objects flying when pushed with it. I felt a sense of satisfaction in possessing such a weapon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As we examined the map, Gwen, Beans, and Bluma engrossed themselves in a discussion. Meanwhile, I noticed a peculiar mushroom nearby. It had numerous bubbles on its surface and swayed gently. Intrigued, I approached it and reached out to touch it.  To my surprise, the bubbles burst, releasing a foul-smelling gas that engulfed the area.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I turned just in time to see the cloud of gas drifting lazily toward the others. Though harmless, it stank like something long-dead and reheated. I let it waft closer, curious to see who’d crack first.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Gwen was the unlucky one. Her face twisted with disgust as she slapped a hand over her nose. “Beans! Did you just </span><span class="c3 c6">fart</span><span class="c0">?” she blurted, her voice muffled behind her fingers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Beans recoiled like he'd been accused of a crime. “No! This isn’t me—this is </span><span class="c3 c6">awful!</span><span class="c0">” he gagged, doubling over as he tried to wave the smell away.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bluma, ever unbothered, gave a single shake of her head and calmly pushed the air aside like it was a mild inconvenience.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I couldn’t stop myself from laughing. “Is everything okay?” I asked, keeping my tone as innocent as possible.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen shot me a withering glare, eyes watering. “Yeah, we’re just—” Her words faltered as the smell intensified. The silence that followed was heavy and awkward.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beans, now looking a bit green, stumbled back a step. “I, uh… I’ll be right back.” He bolted behind a massive mushroom without another word.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen hesitated, nose wrinkled, then followed him without saying anything. Her shoulders were tense, jaw set tight.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A few moments passed, then came the unmistakable noises from behind the mushrooms.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I snorted, unable to hold it in.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bluma looked at me with her bottom two eyes and walked over to me “Explain..” she said in a firm tone but her voice laced with curiosity I then showed her the mushroom.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A few minutes later, Beans and Gwen emerged from behind the mushrooms. Both looked mildly disheveled—Gwen with her lips pressed tight, and Beans avoiding eye contact like the ground had become suddenly fascinating.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Everything okay?” I asked, failing miserably to keep the grin out of my voice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beans gave a stiff nod. “Peachy.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen just muttered, “Shut up,” without meeting my eyes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I shrugged, still smiling. “Hey, just checking.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen growled then cleared her throat, attempting to regain focus. "If we head north for a few miles and then east, we should be able to bypass the temple and reach the city." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I grinned ready to proceed. "Sounds like a plan!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">We continued our journey. After walking for hours, the soft glow of the mushrooms cast eerie shadows that seemed to follow our every step. The forest had grown silent, save for the occasional rustle of leaves, though we could never quite tell if it was the wind or something more. The bioluminescent fungi painted the enormous mushrooms in faint greens and blues, a surreal light that danced along their rough surfaces. Every so often, a low hum resonated from the ground beneath us, as if the earth itself were alive and watching.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">We were walking close together when I turned to Gwen, who seemed on edge. "Do you feel like we’re being followed?" I whispered, my voice barely louder than a breath in the stillness around us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">She nodded, her grip tightening on the hilt of her sword. "Yes, but I can’t tell if it’s real or if it's just this place."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The shifting colors of light pulsed around us, making the forest feel alive—breathing in rhythm with our steps. Some mushrooms cast only faint glimmers that vanished into the dark, while others glowed with an eerie brilliance, bathing the air in strange, otherworldly hues.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The air hung heavy with dampness, thick with the scent of wet earth and slow decay. Distant roars echoed now and then, breaking the silence like claws through fabric. I kept pausing to listen, heart racing. The quiet wasn’t just quiet—it pressed down on us, watchful, like the forest itself was holding its breath.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">After a long stretch of silence, we stumbled into a clearing bordered by jagged rocks and towering mushrooms draped in thick moss. Beans rolled up the map with a flick of his wrist. “Let’s rest here,” he said, glancing around. “We’re almost out of this mushroom forest.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">We all agreed and set up camp. I used my magic to draw roots from the ground beneath us, which Beans chopped down to make a fire. Gwen pitched her tent and disappeared inside the moment it was finished. Once the rest of the camp was prepared, Beans slipped into his tent while I settled down against the base of a towering fungus. Bluma remained on watch, her eyes scanning the forest around us.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16 c8 c6 c14">Gwen’s View</span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c5 c8 c6 c14"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I woke up restless, sleep refusing to come back. “I hate this place,” I muttered, more to the air than anyone. Peeking out of the tent flap, I spotted Bluma sitting by the campfire, her silhouette flickering in the low light. Two other tents stood quiet nearby.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I stepped out, the cool air biting at my arms, and wandered over to her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Hey,” I said, my voice still gravelly. I settled beside her on the mossy ground. “Everyone still out?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Bluma gave a small nod, not looking up. She was focused on cleaning one of her swords—a sleek blade of black metal, its golden hilt etched with strange markings that shimmered in the firelight.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Nice sword… What do those symbols mean?” I asked, getting more comfortable.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">She paused, glanced at me, then around the camp, cautious. With one finger, she wrote in the dirt: </span><span class="c5 c6">Demon’s Wrath.</span><span class="c2"> Then she slid the sword back into its sheath.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“‘Demon’s Wrath,’ huh? Sounds about right.” I gave a dry chuckle, and to my surprise, she echoed it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I nodded toward the blade at her side. “That one yours?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">She pointed at the hilt of my sword instead.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">“Huh? Oh, this thing? The old man who gave it to me called it </span><span class="c5 c6">Fighter’s Spirit</span><span class="c2"> or something like that. Probably enchanted,” I said, unsheathing it. The blade came free with a quiet hiss—massive, wide as my torso, and only a little shorter than me. The scabbard had been built for a longsword, but the blade didn’t quite match the mold.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I offered it to her, curious. Bluma took it with both hands, eyebrows raising when she felt how light it was. She stood, gave it a test swing—clean and practiced—but halfway through, the weight shifted, and the blade shortened. She stumbled, clearly caught off guard.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Impressive,” she murmured, shaking her head. Her eyes sparkled a little as she adjusted her stance. She gave it another couple swings, more controlled this time, then passed it back to me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Yeah,” I said with a smirk, sliding it home. “Way better than the junk I used to swing around. Some old guy named Omar made it for me.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Bluma’s expression shifted. All four of her eyes locked on me at once. “Omar?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I raised a brow. “You know him?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">She nodded, gaze drifting to her own sword. “Same.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">“Wait—he made </span><span class="c5 c6">yours</span><span class="c2"> too?” I blinked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Yes.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">We both fell quiet for a beat. Then, without really trying, we just kept talking. The fire crackled between us, and the night stretched on—soft and strange and a little warmer than before.</span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c5 c8 c6 c14"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16 c8 c6 c14">Deta’s View</span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c5 c8 c6 c14"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">After a long rest, I stretched and yawned, trying to shake off the remnants of sleep. As I glanced down, my eyes widened in surprise. My body had grown roots, deep into the mushroom I’d been lying on. “Well, that’s new,” I muttered, a mix of amusement and unease in my voice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I’d always relied on the sun's energy to keep me going, so waking up with this... this connection to something else, something unexpected, was definitely a surprise.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Turning back toward the tents, I saw Bluma sitting by the dying embers of the fire, but Gwen was nowhere to be seen. "Hey, Bluma... did you sleep well last night?" I asked, suppressing another yawn. Bluma looked up, gave a quick nod, then covered the fire with dirt. I followed her gaze toward Gwen's tent. "Is she still sleeping?" I asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Bluma shook her head. "Cleaning," she said. Just as she spoke, Gwen stepped out of her tent, rolling up her bedding, already preparing for the day.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I smiled and greeted her, "Hey, Gwen, everything alright?" She looked up briefly, gave a nod, then went back to packing her things.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Before long, the rest of the camp stirred, and we all finished tidying up. Beans, ever resourceful, had found some edible mushrooms, He and the others bit into them complaining about the squeaking sound they made as they ate them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">We hadn’t traveled far when a sudden chill crawled down my spine, and I felt an uneasy shift in the air. The feeling was confirmed when Gwen and Bluma instinctively reached for their swords, while Beans scanned the area, and I tightened my grip on my staff. "Anyone else feel that?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I began, just as Gwen cut in with, "Yeah." Beans' eyes darted around. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Whatever it is... We should stay close" I suggested, and everyone nodded in silent agreement.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">A faint growl pierced the stillness, followed by the sharp snap of a twig. We froze. Quickly, we moved into a tight circle, ready to face whatever was approaching. Gwen and Bluma held their swords with precision, Beans raised his ax, and I steadied my staff, eyes searching the dense mushroom forest around us. Then I saw it. "There!" I shouted, pointing at a large Halusanine, foam dripping from its snarling jaws. Its mouth hung open, revealing sharp, menacing teeth as it charged straight for me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"> I shifted into a defensive stance, my body coiling with readiness. But before I could react, the creature’s powerful jaws clamped down on my staff. With a sudden, violent tug, it sent me sprawling through the air, my body hitting the ground with a harsh thud, as if I weighed no more than a leaf.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">In the midst of the chaos, Gwen lunged forward, her sword raised high, ready to strike the beast. Her blade cut through the air, but the Halusanine dodged with unnatural speed. Before we could even react, two more of the creatures emerged from the shadows, flanking Gwen, Bluma, and Beans. The trio of Halusanines circled them, completely ignoring me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Taking advantage of the distraction, I scrambled to my feet and charged one of the beasts, swinging my staff with all my might. But to my shock, my weapon passed right through it, as if it were an illusion. Before I could comprehend what had happened, another Halusanine rammed into me from behind, knocking me off balance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Did you even hit it!?" Gwen shouted, frustration creeping into her voice as she swung her sword again, only to have it slice through the air with no effect.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"I did! It just went right through!" I replied, scrambling to grab my staff from the ground.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Suddenly, three more Halusanines materialized around us, each pairing up with the ones already circling. In an instant, we were completely surrounded.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"How are they multiplying so fast!?" Gwen growled, her eyes darting between the creatures.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"They're Halusanines! They mess with your mind, make you see more of them than there actually are! Didn’t I tell you?" Adam's smug voice echoed from atop a nearby rock, where he stood casually watching us struggle. He chuckled darkly. "You actually thought you could steal my map? How pathetic!" His laughter cut through the tension, fueling Gwen's anger, and I could feel my own frustration boiling over as well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">One of the Halusanines charged at Beans, who barely dodged its snapping jaws. "Whoa! If these things are just illusions, then they can only hurt us if we believe they’re real!" Beans called out, realizing the nature of the creatures.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Adam grinned, his chuckle even darker now. "Clever, aren't you?" he taunted. "But that won’t help with this one. He’s all hyped up on snyfus" His words dripped with malice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Snyfus? What is he talking about?" Beans asked, confusion in his voice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"I don’t know!" Gwen shouted back, frustration evident as she swung the blunt side of her sword like a bat, miraculously striking three of the Halusanines at once. By sheer luck, she hit the real one, causing the others to fade away as it collapsed to the ground.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Snyfus is a virus that infects any life form with enough mental capacity! If it bites you, you’ll go insane!" I warned, urgently summoning roots from the ground to entangle the struggling Halusanine. It growled and barked, desperately fighting to escape.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Adam, watching from his perch, smiled. "Well done, well done. Very few people know about that," he remarked with a chuckle. But before we could shift focus to him, the Halusanine broke free from the roots.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Impressive, for a dead man," Adam said, his voice dripping with smugness.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The creature stood and locked eyes with me, its body tense as it prepared to charge. Gwen stepped forward, ready to intercept it with her sword, and I conjured a flame in my hand. But just as we thought we had it figured out, the beast veered at the last moment, pouncing on Gwen instead, knocking her to the ground. Its jaws were poised to strike at her face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Gwen tried to punch it off, but suddenly, a flash of light struck the Halusanine from the side, sending it flying back. We all froze for a moment. Gwen, catching her breath, noticed a burn mark on the creature’s side—roughly the size of a large fist.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As the Halusanine struggled back to its feet, growling with rage, Gwen stood and prepared for another round. "Your stick can catch fire, bushy?" she asked, surprised to see me holding my staff in one hand, the other ablaze with a flame.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Adam fell silent, no more smug remarks as the Halusanine lunged at us again. Bluma rushed in, her dark black sword now glowing with a faint white light, and with a single, precise swing, she sliced through the beast's hip. The creature let out a howl of pain. Seizing the moment, Gwen brought her sword down with all her strength, severing its head and finally ending its suffering.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As the creature’s lifeless body slumped to the ground, Gwen glanced toward the rock where Adam had been, only to find him gone. "Tch, that brat!" she growled, instinctively ready to give chase. But Beans stepped in front of her, stopping her with a raised hand. "He isn’t worth it," he said, his tone calm but firm.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Gwen hesitated, her frustration boiling over and cursed, throwing her sword to the ground.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As we moved along the path, we found ourselves walking beside a colossal stalagmite that loomed like a mountain. Beans took in the view of the jungle, both above and below us, and remarked, "If it weren't for the constant danger of things trying to kill us, I’d think this place would be fun to come back and visit." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I smiled in agreement. "Yeah, but I don’t think I want to come back and deal with the Halusanine again."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans nodded in understanding. "That’s very true."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Without warning, Beans and I bumped into Bluma and Gwen. "Oh, sorry!" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I apologized to Gwen, but she just rolled her eyes. "Look, bushy," she said, stepping aside. I followed her gaze and noticed a massive cave entrance carved into the wall of the stalagmite. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">In front of it, a pile of rubble suggested something had burrowed inside. Fragments of wood and clothing were scattered among the debris. "What happened here?" I asked, feeling uneasy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Gwen appeared uncertain. "I’m not sure, but whatever it was, it didn’t leave much behind." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Just then, Beans called out from the edge of the path. "I think I found something else." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">We walked over to where Beans stood and looked down to see a strange wooden wagon lying on its side. It had four distinct sections, each with eight wheels on either side. The front was smashed, and a large hole had been dug into the ground where it once stood.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"What on earth...?" I was baffled by the bizarre design of the enormous wagon. When I turned to look for Gwen, though, she had already continued down the trail. "Gwen, where are you going?" I called, concerned. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">She turned back, her voice dripping with disdain. "It’s a slave train. Just keep moving."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Bluma stepped forward and stopped Gwen in her tracks. I glanced at Beans, confused. "A slave train…?" Beans looked at the train, then at Bluma and Gwen. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">“Its how they transport people from the surface" she said, her voice dripping with anxiety.</span><hr/></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><h5 class="c7 c23" id="h.1ksv4uv"><span class="c21">CHAPTER 14</span><span class="c13 c8">                                                                                                                              Old Faces, Old Problems</span></h5><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I peered down at the train and insisted, "What if someone survived? We should at least check." Without waiting for a response, I moved to the edge and prepared to slide down the slope.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Before Beans could finish protesting, I was already descending. "Deta! Stop being so reckless!" he shouted. Gwen and Bluma approached as I slid down. Gwen sighed, and jumped down to catch up. Bluma exchanged glances with Beans and followed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans sighed in frustration. "For the love of...," he muttered, reluctantly joining the rest of us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">When I reached the bottom, I tried to wander closer, however Gwen fell on top of me, sending me face-first into the dirt. She dusted herself off, standing before me. Before we could say anything, a cry of pain echoed nearby, freezing us in place. Bluma and Beans arrived, having heard the scream as they descended. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans looked at me and said, "Well, go on. You’re the one who wanted to help whoever’s down here." His voice carried a hint of unease, and I didn’t blame him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Gathering my nerves, I approached the first section of the wrecked train. Most of it was in ruins, but a door remained somewhat intact, connecting it to the next car. As I reached to open it, the door collapsed, causing me to stumble awkwardly into the next section. To my surprise, the floor was covered in yellow mushrooms and broken crates. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Are you coming?" I called out. Gwen glanced at Bluma and Beans before they followed. Gwen, tense, trailed behind more slowly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Once inside, we surveyed the area. Beans, fascinated by the glowing mushrooms, crouched to gather a few and tucked them into his satchel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Bluma stayed close to Gwen, who seemed increasingly uncomfortable, while I attempted to lift a fallen crate. As I did, I noticed a label written in Dwarvish with large, bold red letters.  Not understanding the text, I flipped the crate and pried it open. After seeing its contents, I slammed it shut. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"What in the ring of hell?” I exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Curious, Beans asked, "What is it?" He noticed the label and grimaced. "Didn't you read it? It says..." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I cut him off, not wanting to dwell on the discovery. "Yep, dead stuff. Uh-huh. No more boxes!" I forced a chuckle, and Beans nodded in agreement.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Bluma, still hovering near Gwen, glanced around. "Mushrooms," she muttered, trying to make conversation. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Gwen nodded, clearly unsettled. "Let’s finish up and get out of here... I don’t like this place." She hugged herself for comfort. Bluma, sensing her discomfort, looked at us. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Right! Good idea," I replied with a smile. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">We ventured further down the train car, encountering more mushrooms and crates with Dwarvish markings. Beans and I exchanged nervous glances, both uneasy about the boxes, though I tried not to think too much about it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">We reached the next door, its handle missing. I pushed it, and it swung loosely like a pendulum. I helped Beans through, and we each managed to squeeze past. On the other side, we found piles of food and leather sacks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans’s stomach growled, making Bluma giggle. "Sorry, haven’t eaten in a while," he said sheepishly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Why don’t you take a break and eat?" I suggested. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Without hesitation, Beans rushed toward the food. "Sold!" he exclaimed. Gwen reluctantly grabbed something to eat as well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I leaned against what used to be the roof, only for it to give way. I tumbled outside. "Whoa!" I yelped, landing on my back. The sound startled everyone, and they rushed over to find me sprawled on the ground. "Sorry about that," I said, standing up and rubbing my head. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Gwen sighed, and Beans laughed. "You scared us for a second there, Deta," he said, grinning. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I chuckled, "Yeah, my bad."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans went outside, collecting broken wood. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"What are you doing?" I asked. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Starting a fire to cook the meat!" he replied. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I shrugged. "Need help?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans grinned. "Sure! You grab some meat while I get the fire going." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I nodded and gathered the food. While doing so, I saw Bluma and Gwen sitting in a corner, Gwen nibbling on an apple. "You two okay?" I asked. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">They nodded. "Yeah, we’re fine."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Smiling, I returned to Beans with the meat. After a brief rest and a meal, we continued exploring the train. As we walked, the hallway narrowed from a four-person space to a tight two-person passage, forcing us to balance carefully with scattered food beneath our feet. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Then, we spotted a massive hammer lodged in the next doorway. "That’s a big hammer," I muttered as we approached it, stating the obvious.</span><span class="c2"> </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Really? I thought it was an apple,” Gwen replied, her voice dripping with sarcasm. “You know, just your typical fruit, oversized and made of steel.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans, peering around my leg, recognized it. "Oh! A crystal breaker!" he exclaimed, dashing around me and toward it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Bluma rushed after him, grabbing the collar of his armor and yanking him back just in time. A long blue tongue shot from the hammer, narrowly missing Beans. Bluma, quick on her feet, unsheathed her sword and pinned the tongue to the ground, causing the hammer to let out a piercing scream. Eyes and teeth emerged from its form. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Shifter!" Bluma shouted, warning us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The creature lunged at Bluma, but she dodged, slamming into the wall to evade it. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Meanwhile, Beans, wide-eyed, punched the creature as it landed near him, and the impact sent the creature flying back. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Gwen and I wanted to help, but the narrow hallway made it impossible without risking getting hurt.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Bluma wasted no time. She charged the creature, swinging her sword, but it dodged with eight long, dark legs, avoiding a fatal blow. It scurried up the wall and leaped toward Gwen and me. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Watch out!" Beans yelled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">We jumped back as the shifter hit the ground, splattering blood everywhere. Its form deteriorated, and Gwen seized the moment, driving her sword into the hammer’s head. The creature screeched before falling silent, its true form reverting to an amorphous blob. Gwen pulled her sword from its remains, disgusted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Covering her mouth, Gwen exclaimed, "I’m gonna be sick..." Her eyes wide, she bolted, Bluma then squeezed around us and followed close behind. A soft splat sound told us she didn’t make it far. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">I noticed her sword on the ground, so I picked it up and wiped the purple blood off with a rag. "Yuck... What even was that?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Just as I finished, Gwen and Bluma returned. Gwen strode over, scooped up her sword, and gave me a curt nod of thanks—grudging, but genuine. Bluma lingered a step behind her, silent as always, though her eyes flicked over me with a quiet sort of approval.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I smiled. "No problem. Are we ready to keep moving?" I stored the cloth in my bag as the two nodded. Bluma led the way into the next car, but as she opened the door, she froze.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Bluma? What’s wrong?" I asked, but she didn’t respond. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans peeked through her legs and muttered, "You’re kidding…"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">My curiosity grew. "What is it?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Gwen tapped my shoulder and pointed to the roof. I glanced up and saw an upside-down sign that read, “Slave Room.” My eyes widened as I took in the scene. Inside, bodies of slaves from various races and species were scattered in cages. It was a grim sight.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">We stood in silence until the sound of a box falling startled us, and we drew our weapons. A gray hand, chained to the wall, caught my attention. I stepped closer and heard a faint groan. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"They’re alive!" I shouted. We rushed to clear the debris, revealing a familiar face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"...you..."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Gwen tightened her grip on her sword, and a wave of bitterness washed over me. </span><span class="c5">Beans looked at us and then at the unconscious figure. "Is that—?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I nodded. "Rinn."</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16 c8 c6 c14">Rinn’s View</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c5 c8 c6 c14"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">After a while, I stirred, my body aching as I realized I was chained to a giant mushroom. My eyes darted around the area—tents scattered in a circle and a campfire flickering nearby. Someone sat close to the flames, their silhouette hunched over. It hit me then: I was trapped. I yanked at the chains, but they didn’t budge. The clinking sound drew the attention of the figure by the fire—a Dwarf. He stood up and walked toward me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“You’re awake,” he said, stopping just out of reach.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I shot him a glare, my voice rough. “I’m fine.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The Dwarf crossed his arms, clearly unimpressed. “That’s no way to talk to someone who might just save your life.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I couldn’t help but scoff. “You? Save me? You expect me to believe that?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">He sighed, turning his back to me. “Hey, he’s up,” he called out to the camp. As he moved away, three figures emerged from the tents. Two of them I recognized instantly, and I couldn’t stop the sinking feeling in my gut. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Oh, for the love of…”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Gwen approached me, a smug grin on her face. “How does it feel to have the tables turned?” She reached for the collar around my neck, but I kept my mouth shut, refusing to give her the satisfaction.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">She chuckled, but then the young creature beside her placed a hand on her shoulder. “Gwen, don’t antagonize him.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Gwen shrugged, backing off like it didn’t matter. “Fine. This is enough payback.” She wandered back to her tent, leaving me alone with the creature.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I sneered at them, my frustration boiling over. “What do you want, young creature?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">They smiled softly, reaching into their bag and pulling out some bread.</span><span class="c2"> They broke it in half and offered me a piece. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I hesitated, then took it reluctantly. “Are you going to try and make me your slave?” I asked, my voice laced with suspicion as I took a bite.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Their eyes widened, looking startled. “No. I don’t want a slave.” They glanced at the bracelet around my neck, their expression turning serious. “What’s with the bracelet?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I sighed, my hand brushing against it. “It’s a slave brace. The people who caught me put this on, planning to sell me. It stays on for seven years, which is why Gwen doesn’t have hers anymore.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">They chuckled awkwardly, clearly uneasy. “Is there any other way to get it off?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I shot them a sharp look. “You think I’m going to believe you’ll free me? A Dark Elf, who would kill you without a second thought?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">They sighed, their tone softening. “Stand with us for now, and we’ll see about getting it off.” </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">I did not answer,  there is no way that this creature is </span><span class="c5 c6">this</span><span class="c2"> incompetent. </span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c5 c8 c6 c14"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16 c8 c6 c14">Deta’s View</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c5 c8 c6 c14"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Rinn stayed silent as I returned to the camp. "What’s the matter?" Gwen asked, chewing on a piece of meat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Nothing. Let’s just get out of here." I gazed at the ceiling of the underworld. "I’d like to see the sun again."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Gwen sighed heavily, her shoulders slumping. She watched the bone sizzle in the fire, remembering her old, painful memories of this place. "A lot of people would." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans and Bluma emerged from their tent, their arrival snapping her back to the present, but the shadows of the past still lingered in her eyes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Alright, everyone! We’ve got the map figured out, ready to go?" Beans asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Rinn’s ears twitched, but he couldn’t move much, still bound by chains. We packed up the camp and continued through the mushroom jungle. Gwen held Rinn’s chains while I looked up, spotting a flock of small creatures in the sky. I smiled briefly before focusing on the path ahead.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As we walked, I noticed potholes along the sides, filled with water and floating bones. "Beans?" I called out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Yeah?" He responded half way, distracted by the map.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Did we take a wrong turn?" I asked, eyes fixed on bones that laid across the ground.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans checked the map and frowned, now noticing the bones too. "Malachite holes…?" he muttered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Before anyone could react, three frog-like creatures crawled out of the holes. Their bodies were covered in fresh wounds and their mouths dripped with blood.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Bluma and Gwen drew their swords, and Beans readied his hand ax. I conjured fire in one hand and cracked my whip in the other.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The creatures screeched and charged. Bluma’s sword gleamed as she drove it through the first Malachite, killing it. Gwen blocked another’s attack, using her sword to fling it back. Beans dodged the swipes of the third, too quick for the creature to land a hit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The third Malachite lunged at Rinn, who was still bound. I whipped its arm, pulling it back and hit it with a fireball. It screeched in pain. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Thanks, young creature…" Rinn muttered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I turned back to him. "Call me Deta." Then I noticed two more creatures emerging. "More of them?!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Rinn groaned. "Malachites live in tribes. There’s bound to be more."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Bluma swiftly decapitated one of the creatures. Gwen punched another, driving her sword through its chest. "I hate frogs!" she yelled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I retracted my whip and retrieved my staff, delivering a powerful blow to one of the Malachites, causing it to fly into its companions. Mistaking the attack for an internal assault, they started fighting among themselves. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rinn looked at us and urged, "Let's get going!" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I nodded, turning to the others, and we all swiftly made our escape. As we began running, the screeching of the Malachites gradually faded, providing us a momentary sense of relief. We slowed our pace. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"I hate frogs," Gwen groaned.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beans, still catching his breath, huffed in agreement. "Couldn't... agree... more, ugh," he managed to say. </span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Glancing back after catching my breath, I questioned, "Why did they attack us?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bluma sheathed her sword, sighing with relief. "Territorial," she explained, looking at me before walking over to join Gwen and Beans.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rinn nodded and added, "Yes, Malachites are very territorial. But not that inclined to knowledge." He chuckled. "If we keep moving, they'll likely forget about us in a few days." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen sheathed her sword but kept her hand firmly on the hilt. "A few days is longer than we have. We need to find a way to escape." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I nodded in agreement. "Yes, let's keep moving and try to find a way out."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Sounds like a plan to me," Beans replied, finally catching his breath and straightening up. He pulled out the map, attempting to determine our next course of action.</span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16 c6 c17">Beans’ View</span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rinn approached me from behind and peered at the map from above. I noticed his shadow, Not trusting him I cleared my throat and readjusting the map. "What do you want, Dark Elf?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rinn, with his hands bound by cuffs, pointed to a specific area on the map. "If we head north for a few hours, we can avoid theTrade Center." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I looked at him curiously. "First, what is this Trade Center?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rinn let out a sigh. "In the Underworld, Trade Centers are places where various items are exchanged—goods, monsters, and slaves, to name a few." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I proceeded </span><span class="c3">with my questions</span><span class="c0">. "Second, why should I trust a Dark Elf?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rinn rolled his eyes, visibly annoyed. "You Dwarves are always so pretentious... It is in my best interest, as well as hers," he gestured towards Gwen, who was engaged in conversation with Deta, "Avoid the Trade Center or they won't leave… they are valuable after all, the person who gives them away, with their strength and magic, would be set for life.."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I could feel a grin form on his face as his words tried to slither their way trying to convince me. Bluma then put her hand onto my shoulder as she knelt down at my level and looked to me with two of her golden soft eyes. The other two looked at Rinn, sharp and narrow.</span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16 c6 c17">Deta’s View</span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Why don't we just leave him? It's not like we need him," Gwen declared loudly, her crossbow in hand as she walked away. "We could make it out on our own."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"> I let out a sigh. "Well, maybe, but..." I glanced at Rinn and then back at Gwen. "He deserves a second chance." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen placed her palm on her face in disbelief. "Unbelievable... You're going to give a murderer a second chance!" With that, she walked off.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I tried to call out to Gwen to get her to come back but she had already walked off. As I stood there in defeat, a pulling sensation began to build in my chest, with an almost melodious ring to it "It's the Soul Stone…” I whispered, looking back at the group I thought to myself. "I need to get to it."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beans rolled his eyes and addressed me. "Alright, there's a city that way. If we're lucky, they might have a way out. If not then we can at least get something to eat." His attention then turned to where Gwen was, but had disappeared. "Where did she go?" </span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16 c8 c6 c17">Gwen’s View</span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c3 c8 c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I made my way through the thick brush of the mushroom jungle, crossbow at the ready, still seething. "I swear... Deta is too soft," I muttered, my grip tightening on the weapon. The thought of him letting Rinn live after everything—that monster—made my blood boil. Seven years of torture, and Deta had the nerve to show him kindness. How could he even think Rinn deserved mercy? After all the pain he'd caused us—caused me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The quiet around me was shattered by the sound of children giggling nearby. I paused, forcing my anger down as I turned toward the laughter, cautiously approaching their location.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the distance, I spotted a little Dark Elf boy and girl playing, with glowing pink Fufus floating around them. A smile tugged at my lips as I watched their joy, but my attention quickly shifted to a nearby pit, glowing ominously red. From the pit, a hand emerged, followed by a small child-sized creature made of burning earth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Instinctively, I reached for my sword, but before I could fully draw it, three more of the creatures crawled out, their attention quickly fixating on the children. They rushed towards them, the Fufus turning red and fleeing the scene. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The boy noticed the danger and shouted, "Run, Lann!" as he grabbed his sister's hand and began to run. But the little girl stumbled, falling to the ground.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She turned back, screaming in terror as the creatures closed in. I burst out of the bushes, dropping my crossbow and pulling out my sword, charging toward them. With a swift strike, I knocked one of the creatures backward with the blunt side of my sword.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"> "Get out of here!" I yelled to the children, who scrambled to their feet and ran. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A Dark Elf woman, hearing my shout, rushed over, her eyes wide with fear as she called out, "Shunn! Lann!" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The children ran to her, and I turned my focus back to the fight. I swung my sword, slicing through one of the creature’s torsos. It let out a screech as it split into two pieces, each glowing intensely. Sensing an explosion, I planted my sword into the ground and ducked behind it just as the creature burst in a fiery blast of magma.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The remaining three creatures, enraged by the death of their comrade, charged at me. I quickly grabbed my crossbow from off the ground, firing a bolt into the head of one of them, which exploded, splattering magma all around. Some of it hit my right arm. I cursed, shaking off the burning liquid. My arm throbbed in pain, burning deep and angry.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As the last creature lunged for my hair, I dodged, leaping out of the way and delivering a hard kick that sent it tumbling into a nearby lake. It sank beneath the surface, its fiery glow fading into the depths until it was gone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Breathing heavily, I walked over to retrieve my sword, feeling the sting in my arm as I sheathed it. My eyes fell on the Dark Elf woman and her children, the fear still clear on their faces. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Softly, I said, "You should keep a closer watch on your kids." I turned to leave, but the little girl’s voice stopped me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Here!" she called, holding out a stuffed Fufu toy with both hands, a bright smile on her face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I blinked in surprise, hesitating. "Are you sure? I wouldn’t want to take it from you," I said, glancing at the toy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She nodded eagerly. "Mhm! Here!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With a soft smile, I took the stuffed Fufu and gently patted its head. "Thank you," I told her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"His name is Shelly! Take good care of him!" she announced before running back to her mother. They waved as they walked away, and I found myself waving back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Looking down at the toy in my hands, I chuckled softly. "Well, Shelly, looks like you’re coming with me." I tucked the little toy into my bag and made my way back to the group through the brush.</span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c3 c8 c6"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16 c6 c17">Deta’s View</span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">I watched as </span><span class="c5">Beans played with his hand ax when we heard the rustling sound coming from off the path. He readied his weapon but lowered it as Gwen emerged from the bushes. </span><span class="c2">"Oh, you're back," he greeted her with a smile, putting away his ax. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Gwen nodded. "Yeah, I'm back." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I noticed her red cloth that was around her waist now wrapped around her arm. “Did you get hurt?” I asked her. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">While glancing at Rinn, eyes narrowed with hate, she answered that she was fine and then turned to Beans. "Have you figured out a way yet?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans nodded in affirmation. "Yep–” </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I interrupted as fast as I could “Yes! It's that way!” I pointed in the general direction I felt the call before starting to head off. I need to help that Randeth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Gwen rolled her eyes playfully. "Well, let's get going then." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I smiled and stood up from where I had been sitting on the ground. Bluma walked over to Gwen and patted her on the back, and Beans led the way as we continued through the jungle.</span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr/><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><h5 class="c7 c23" id="h.2jxsxqh"><span class="c21">CHAPTER 15</span><span class="c13 c8">                                                                                                                        Don't Be Fooled</span></h5><p class="c9 c44"><span class="c8 c14 c22 c52"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As we continued, Gwen and I exchanged glances, both noticing the ground beneath us transitioning from soft dirt to smooth stone. The dim jungle light faded behind us, and the air felt different—less damp, more still. I glanced around, curiosity bubbling up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Hey, Beans? Where exactly are we heading?" I asked, my voice breaking the quiet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before he could answer, Rinn cut in with his usual smug tone. "We are approaching our only connection to the Overworld. Welcome to the Crystal Plains."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The transformation was striking. Gone were the towering fungi and their eerie glow. Instead, immense crystals floated serenely above the ground, refracting light in shimmering patterns. The terrain stretched out, flat and vast, and far in the distance, a city gleamed like a mirage beneath the crystal sky.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The crystals emitted a gentle, comforting glow, imbued with an air of mystery. "Wow... These crystals are really pretty," I murmured, reaching out to touch one as we continued walking. Some of them towered so high I couldn’t see the top.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beans crouched to the ground and picked up a shard, his eyes wide with wonder. “I’ve never seen anything quite like this before,” he said, turning it over in his hands.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I gathered a few of my own, the facets catching flashes of distant light. “These are so cool! I can’t wait to show Vomete!” I stuffed them into my backpack, grinning.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Behind me, Rinn gave a low chuckle. “You're quite taken with them, young one,” he said, his tone almost too smooth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen was tracing her fingers along one of the floating crystals, her brow furrowed. “I don’t like how quiet it is here,” she muttered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rinn’s smile deepened, but there was no warmth in it. “You catch on quickly,” he said. “Despite its calm exterior and your lack of memories, this place is infested with horrors. Lurking. Watching. So yes... tread carefully.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He let the warning hang in the air like smoke, clearly enjoying the tension he’d stirred.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beans turned to him with a groan. “Now you tell us?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rinn only smirked in response, the corners of his mouth curling with amusement. With an exaggerated roll of his eyes, Beans gave up on arguing, and we resumed our trek across the crystalline expanse.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As we passed a colossal shard jutting from the ground like a jagged monument, something caught my eye—a structure in the distance, tucked just off the path to our left.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Hey, Rinn…” I called out, narrowing my eyes. “Is there supposed to be a house here?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My words brought everyone to a halt. One by one, heads turned to follow my gaze, landing on the lone house nestled among the crystals. The silence returned, heavier than before.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Constructed from wood and various other materials from the Overworld, it seemed very out of place in this underground. Beans scratched his head in bewilderment. "A shack… down here?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen turned to Rinn with a sneer. “Any thoughts on this, creep?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rinn didn’t rise to the insult, only rolled his eyes as if her hatred amused him. He studied the structure in the distance with a thoughtful hum. “How peculiar…” he said, voice slow and deliberate. “I’ve never seen an Overworld structure this deep. Someone’s either lost—or hiding.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He glanced at her then, the corner of his mouth twitching upward. “Curious, isn’t it?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As we stared at the house, a sharp, high-pitched ringing sliced through the air. It wasn’t loud, but it drilled straight into my skull, like pressure behind the eyes. My vision warped for a heartbeat—colors bleeding into each other, the edges of the world smearing like wet paint. A sudden weight pressed down on my limbs, heavy and unnatural, as if gravity had thickened around me. I blinked, staggered slightly, but the feeling clung like cobwebs.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, cutting through the stillness, came a deep masculine voice from behind us—sudden, calm, and entirely out of place.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"So, you've stumbled upon my humble home…”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We turned, startled by the unexpected voice, and saw a towering figure with purple skin and a crystal beard standing before us. He had two green circles in a metal frame that rested on his nose and caught the light from the crystals.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beans gripped his ax tightly and demanded, "Who are you?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The man glanced down at Beans and calmly replied, "Call me Nek’tar. I am a humble researcher, so your weapons are unnecessary."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was hard to trust his words, considering our encounters thus far in this dangerous underground realm. I should’ve been more cautious too, but... something about his voice made the tension in my shoulders ease. My thoughts felt distant for a moment—like they were echoing through fog.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sensing our skepticism, Nek'tar addressed our hesitation, saying, "Please, join me in my home. You must be weary from your travels."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With that, Nek'tar proceeded forward. I looked back at the group, unsure of what to do. "Should we... see if he—?" I began.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before I could finish, Gwen exploded, "Absolutely not! We won’t be lured into another trap!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rinn nodded in agreement, adding, "I’ve heard stories of a figure dwelling in this area—a creature that seeks knowledge by devouring brains."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I gave a nervous smile. “But those are just stories, right?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My voice sounded distant to my own ears, like it was coming from somewhere else. I blamed it on fatigue, shaking my head lightly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rinn’s eyes narrowed as he shrugged. “In the underworld, the line between truth and tale is as thin as smoke.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Feeling a mix of nervousness and uncertainty, I sighed, “Okay, then…”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But before anyone could speak further, Beans called out, “Hey, dark elf... What are those flying things up there?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rinn rolled his eyes and turned to look—then froze. His expression shifted in an instant. The usual arrogance drained from his face as his eyes locked onto three towering creatures circling above. They had wings like torn shadows, beaks sharp enough to pierce steel, and twelve writhing tentacles that slithered and coiled like grotesque serpents. Their bodies were a nightmare stitched together from impossible parts—glistening, slick, and alien.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A screech tore through the air, a sound so shrill and unnatural that it felt like it ripped into my very soul. It echoed, bouncing off the walls, deep and unsettling, as if the noise itself was a weapon, designed to tear away any semblance of sanity. The tentacles flailed, twitching with an insidious hunger, while their beaks snapped, eager to sink into flesh.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Every movement they made felt wrong, like they didn’t belong in this world at all. Their presence alone was enough to make the air feel heavier, darker... suffocating.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Nu’puls…” Rinn breathed, his voice a whisper of panic. Then louder—“We need to run! Now!”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The creatures dove, talons flashing, their massive forms cutting through the air like knives.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0">Gwen groaned and cursed “Everyone, to the researcher’s house!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With urgency, we sprinted toward Nek’tar's home, desperate to escape the pursuing creatures or at least buy enough time to come up with a plan. Bluma swiftly carried Beans, who was starting to lag behind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rinn stumbled, hindered by his chains, was pulled back as one of the towering beings screeched, its wings rustling ominously as it extended its tentacles, closing in on Rinn. Just as it was about to reach him, he fell to his knees, bracing for the worst. He shut his eyes, only to feel a sudden force tackle him aside. Rolling on the ground, he realized Bluma had pushed him, saving him from the creature's grasp.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bluma glared at him with the bottom set of eyes, pulling Rinn to his feet. We continued our frantic dash toward Nek'tar’s house. Bluma quickly opened the door, and we rushed inside just as one of the towering creatures slammed against it, trying to force its way in. Gwen spotted a crystal couch and made a move toward it, Rinn rushed to help her lift it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“I don’t need YOUR help!” she yelled at him, her voice rising above the chaos as she strained to lift the heavy couch. Her muscles burned, each inch of movement demanding more than she felt capable of giving.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He groaned in frustration, sweat glistening on his brow. “Hate me later!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The creature’s tentacles smashed through a window, grabbing Beans' leg and trying to pull him out. “Let me go!” Beans shouted, struggling fiercely. He managed to grab his small ax and struck the tentacle, causing the monster to screech and release him. Disoriented, Beans dropped his ax but steadied himself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The creature relentlessly slammed against the door again, each impact reverberating through the air like a drumbeat of dread. Bluma pressed her back against the splintering wood, muscles straining as she struggled to keep it shut. Her heart raced in time with the creature's violent assaults, each crash sending jolts of fear through her. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beans and I surged forward to help Bluma, our combined weight pressing against the door. The creature slammed against it again, its force nearly overwhelming. My hands gripped the splintering wood, and I leaned my shoulder into it, fighting against the creature's relentless assaults.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"We need to keep it out!" I shouted, my voice barely breaking through the chaos.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With a final, thunderous thud, the monster broke through part of the door, its sharp beak piercing inside, splinters flying as the wood splintered under the pressure. Bluma felt the cold rush of panic swell within her. She shifted her position, wedging her shoulder against the frame, but the added weight of the creature’s mass made it harder to maintain her grip. The relentless creature pushed, its beak inching closer, a dark void framed by jagged edges. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Desperation clawed at her throat as she fought to keep the door closed, sweat beading on her brow. With every ounce of strength, she pressed against the door, her breathing growing shallow. She could feel the creature's hot breath on her face, a terrifying reminder of how close it was to breaking through. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Gwen, help us!” I called as she hoisted the heavy couch. Standing up, I gripped my magic staff tight, swinging it at the creature’s beak and sending it flying. Gwen and Rinn seized the opportunity to wedge the couch against the door with a resounding thud. Sweating from the effort, they gasped for breath. I tried to help her but couldn’t even lift the couch.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“How heavy is this thing?! It feels like it weighs a million tons!” I exclaimed in frustration. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen chuckled, replying, “Heavy enough to keep those monsters out.” They tried to straighten their backs just as another creature tried to break through. But with the couch in place, it couldn’t succeed and thrashed its tentacles in frustration. Gwen growled and grabbed a pillow, throwing it at the creature’s tentacles.”Just leave us alone already!” Just as she reached for her sword, mistaking the pillow for possible food, the creature gripped it tight and, along with the others, flew away.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We all let out a collective sigh of relief, but it was short-lived—another screech echoed from outside. Two smaller ones flew in through the windows. One landed on Beans’ head, while the other darted around, trying to attach itself to one of us. Gwen unsheathed her sword, attempting to strike the small beast, but with the small area of movement, it dodged every move. Meanwhile, the one on Beans clung tightly, digging into his flesh. In agony, Beans cried, “Get this thing off me!” He struggled fiercely to pry it loose.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"I’ll help!" I shouted. I grabbed Beans' ax from the floor, using its blunt side to swing at the creature. Its exposed body burst on impact. In my eagerness, I swung again but accidentally hit Beans on the head. "Ow! Dang it, Deta!" he barked, rubbing his head.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Sorry!" I quickly apologized as the creature fell dead to the floor.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">It was then that a voice from behind us spoke. "Well... seems you decided to come after all."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Still on edge from the fight, our group spun around. Nek'tar sat in a grand-backed chair that hadn’t been there before, a delicate teacup held between his fingers. The steam rising from it smelled faintly of lavender and something darker, almost metallic.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">He set the cup down with a soft clink. Gwen, tense, instinctively gripped her sword’s hilt.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nek’tar sighed, the sound strangely hollow. “Be at ease, half-elf. I do not intend to harm you as my brother would.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans blinked, brow furrowed. “You're an elf!?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Gwen’s gaze remained locked on Nek’tar, her tone clipped. “Half, genius.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nek’tar stood, movements smooth but almost too fluid, as though the air resisted him. He gestured lazily toward a nearby room. “Please, make yourselves comfortable in the meeting room. I shall join you shortly.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">When I glanced left, I saw the room he spoke of—though I was sure it hadn’t been there before. Cushioned chairs in a perfect semi-circle, the walls shifting in tone like candlelight on water.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Alright, let’s go, guys,” I said, voice sounding distant to my own ears, motioning them inside.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans, of course, couldn’t help but prod. “Why didn’t you tell us you were an elf?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Gwen rolled her eyes. “I’m sorry I forgot to share my entire life story with you. It’s none of your business!”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans scoffed. “Of course, an elf would think like that—”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Gwen stood so fast her chair skidded. “Half! I am not an elf!”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Bluma’s sword gleamed in the flickering light as she stepped between them, her voice quiet but firm. “Half.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Trying to steady the rising tension, I spoke gently, though my throat felt dry. “Gwen, we understand... but why do you have such strong feelings against elves?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Rinn interjected, always curious, “Pardon my intrusion, but—”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Don’t you dare finish that sentence,” Gwen growled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Bluma slowly sheathed her sword, the motion oddly delayed, like time was stretching at the edges. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“My… captor. Was a purist elf… I’ve been in slavery and tortured for it, for as long as I can remember, which isn’t much anymore.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Rinn looked away. The light on his skin shimmered strangely. His voice, for once, was barely audible. “Given the extent of her physical and emotional trauma… the memories would fade along with the scars. That’s the nature of the restoration potion.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Gwen’s breath trembled. “My first owner kept me for twenty-one years. Having a slave that long is considered an ill omen.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Rinn’s shadow seemed to flicker even in the still air. “He couldn’t wait to dump his cursed burden, so he sold you to me for a measly copper.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Gwen snapped, lunging—but before she made contact, Nek’tar lifted a finger. With a pulse like thunder muffled underwater, she collapsed into her seat, frozen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Hey!” Gwen cried, unable to rise.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nek’tar’s calm smile returned. “Please, no violence. I just had the carpets cleaned from your entrance.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">He sat beside me, the warmth of his presence oddly cold. “Now, let’s get down to business. Who owns the dark elf?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I swallowed. My mouth tasted like ash. “Uh… none of us… We’re trying to free him.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Nek’tar’s eyes shimmered white. “Fascinating… Even after what he’s done? He </span><span class="c5 c6">did</span><span class="c2"> kidnapped your friend Rose.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Her name echoed, a soft whisper that seemed to linger in the air. I blinked, feeling the weight of it.</span><span class="c5 c8 c6 c14"> "How... Do you know that?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">His voice slithered through the air, curling around me like smoke, then suddenly, it was inside my head. “</span><span class="c5 c6">Will you claim him as your slave, or do you still intend to save him?</span><span class="c2">”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">My heart pounded. Images flooded in—Rose smiling, then screaming, tortured by magic, burned alive. I clutched my head. “Stop it!” I cried.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">But his voice merged with her scream. </span><span class="c5 c8 c6 c14">What will you do, Randeth? Will you let the fire consume you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I opened my eyes—and flames consumed me. The heat was unbearable. I screamed, thrashing, the scent of scorched flesh filling my nose. My skin blistered, vision warped in waves of heat. Nek’tar’s face loomed. I struck him, and he flew back—</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Then the fire vanished.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I sat in the chair again. The air was cool. No one else remained.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I gasped, checking my limbs—no burns. No smoke. “What the hell…”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Everyone was gone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Gwen?” I called. “Beans? Bluma?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Silence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I staggered through the hall. Shadows curled along the walls. In a circular mirror, I caught my reflection—my eyes glowed pink.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“I’m… under a spell,” I muttered. My fists clenched. “When did that happen? Where is—”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">A door creaked open.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I rushed through it. “Nek’tar!”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Roots tangled around the entrance. I shoved through, breath quickening.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">At the base of a staircase, a room bathed in pink light waited. Four pillars burned with ghostly flame. When I turned to leave—the stairs were gone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">A voice spoke. I turned.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Rose stood in a black gown, eyes shining with fury. “No thanks to you.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Rose! You’re okay!” I stepped forward—</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Stay back.” Her hands burned with pink fire.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Rose, I tried to save you—”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“But you didn’t.” She raised a sword of flame.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Rose, please!”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">She charged. Her blade slashed, searing off my arm. I cried out, stumbling.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">In desperation, I kicked her back, summoning roots. They twisted around her like snakes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“I hate you!” she screamed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“…I’m sorry, Rose…” My voice broke. “I tried to save you…”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Her screams followed me even as I shut the door.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I slumped against it, exhausted. Books scattered around. “I wanted to help you…”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">My arm… had healed. Fully.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c8 c6 c14"> What…? I shouldn't be able to heal that fast…</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I rose, now unsure of anything. “Maybe I can still help…”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Opening the door again—an endless black ocean. I slammed it shut.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Next, a field of flowers under a too-blue sky. To the north, a kingdom. South, a forest.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I stepped forward—</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The ground swallowed me whole.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“No!” I screamed, flailing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Darkness.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Then light.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I blinked. A cave.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Rubert?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">He beamed. “Yes, good sir!”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I ran to him, embraced him—then froze.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“I wouldn’t be so sure about that,” he said, and changed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">His form melted away, robes and floppy hat replacing his features. A man smiled where Rubert had been.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“What are you doing?” I asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Wake up, Deta.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The world shattered like glass.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">And I awoke.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans’ hand reaching down, voice raw with panic—</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Deta! Wake up!”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Confusion and panic gripped me as I realized I was trapped in a small crevasse in the ground. "What's going on?!" I asked, my voice trembling. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I watched as Bluma was thrown over Beans, and he urgently shouted, "No time! Hurry, grab my hand!" Struggling to free my arm, I finally managed to squeeze it out from my side and reached out, desperately grasping for Beans' hand. "Guys! He's awake! Help!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">I watched in horror as the colossal, purple, worm-like monster with countless teeth in its gaping maw roared, its massive form descending upon us. The air vibrated with the sound of its rage, and in an instant, its terrifying presence engulfed us, casting a shadow over everything.</span><hr/></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><h5 class="c7 c23" id="h.z337ya"><span class="c21">CHAPTER 16 </span><span class="c13 c8">                                                                                                                              The Belly of the Beast</span></h5><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I woke up on the ground, finding it strangely soft, slimy, and pink. Quickly regaining my footing, I scanned my surroundings, calling out, "Guys!? Where are you?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Worry crept in as I spotted the scattered rocks and rubble, fearing my friends had been crushed. I rushed toward the pile, just as Gwen's head poked out from beneath the debris, struggling to free herself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Stupid worm," she muttered, her frustration clear. When she saw me, she quipped, "About time you woke up! Now help me out of here, Bushy!" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I hurried over, eagerly shifting rocks to help her escape. As she stepped onto the squishy ground, she sighed. "Thanks," she said, glancing around. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Where—?" I started but before I could finish, more rocks tumbled down, revealing Bluma and Beans, with Rinn perched on Bluma's shoulders.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Relief washed over me, and I smiled. "You guys are okay!" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bluma nodded confidently. "Yeah, it takes more than that to bring us down." Beans smiled proudly. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Chuckling, I added, "I'm glad we all can see in the dark well but... what happened?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen exhaled sharply, her eyes flashing with anger as she said, "That geode creature put us under a spell. When I woke up, we were chained up on a cart, like we were nothing more than property. He was planning to sell us as slaves." Her fists clenched tightly, her voice thick with fury. "I got in one good hit on him, but then that giant worm showed up and ruined everything."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beans nodded. "Yeah, Bluma and I broke free after the worm destroyed the cart. It ripped whatever his name was in half and turned on us."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen glanced at Rinn and sneered. "Wow, the princess is still out cold.” </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beans looked at Rinn and saw chains on him, "weird..." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen frowned. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"What is it?" Beans pointed to the glowing green chains.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen’s laugh started low, almost as if she couldn’t believe what she was seeing. It grew louder, richer, like a weight lifting off her chest, each note sharpening. It wasn’t just joy—it was the sound of justice finally catching up, a bitter edge woven into every gasp for air. Her eyes gleamed with satisfaction as the laughter spilled out, unstoppable, a release of everything she’d held inside for so long.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Look at that! The chains have changed color! Just what he deserves for all the pain he caused!” Gwen grinned, her arms crossed smugly as she took in Rinn’s new, shackled state. Her eyes danced with cruel delight, unable to mask the vindication she felt.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Confused, I asked, "What do you mean?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Still chuckling, Gwen replied, "That means someone has claimed him as a slave. I wonder who it is!" She couldn't stop giggling. “Can't be that crystal dude because he is definitely dead, so that means one of us did it when we were being swallowed!” She laughed more, hunching over to hold herself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Meanwhile, Beans noticed his hand ax had become lodged in the ground. As he pulled it out, the whole area trembled, and a deafening roar filled the air. Startled, I instinctively covered my ears, as did the others.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When the noise subsided, we noticed the walls and ceiling contracting and expanding, accompanied by a low, rhythmic breathing. Gwen’s laughter now gone, frowned. "Looks like we're inside the purple worm..." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My eyes widened. "What!? We're inside it!?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beans echoed, "We're... inside a worm?" It took a moment for the realization to sink in. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Glancing up, I noticed the worm’s spine arching above us, a jagged, sinuous ridge pressing against the fleshy ceiling like the backbone of some ancient beast. It stretched on endlessly, its segmented bones shifting with each subtle tremor, reminding me just how alive—and massive—the creature we were trapped inside truly was.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">“</span><span class="c3">How</span><span class="c0"> do we get out?” Beans asked, his voice trembling with anxiety as his eyes darted around, scanning for any signs of escape. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen surveyed the area, her gaze sharp and focused, before climbing atop the rocks for a better vantage point. She pointed toward a dark, elongated opening that tapered at one end, its smooth, muscular walls glistening slightly to us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"> "Over here! Let's try breaking through." she then jumped down the other side.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beans and I followed her up the rocks, while Bluma stayed with Rinn's unconscious body. Gwen swung her sword at the closed esophagus, but nothing happened. "Tch," she scoffed, striking it again to no avail.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Here, let me try!" Beans jumped down, swinging his ax at the obstruction, but it didn't budge. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was standing at the top of the rock pile—watching, when suddenly, a cold sensation crept up my back. Panicking, I slid down the rocks, landing near Beans and Gwen. Looking up, I saw two jellyfish-like creatures drifting toward us. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Gwen! Beans!" I called urgently. They stopped and followed my gaze.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Seeing the white jellyfish, the group readied their weapons, but to our surprise, it floated effortlessly through the closed esophagus, as if it were not there. "What... was that thing?" I asked </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"I don't know. Stay on guard," Beans responded, his ax held tight. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen said, glancing at me, still on the ground. "You gonna get up or just stay there?" she teased.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Laughing, I stood. "It gave me a jump scare."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen rolled her eyes while Beans chuckled, but our relief was short-lived. A white tentacle lashed out, wrapping around Beans' arm. He screamed in pain as the creature tried to pull him into the fleshy walls. Gwen reacted quickly, slicing the tentacle with her sword.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beans threw the severed tentacle aside, acid hissing as the tentacle splattered on the ground, his skin was a mess of blistered, raw flesh, the acid having burned deep in the few seconds it touched him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Beans! Are you okay?" I asked, panic rising in my voice as I rushed toward him, unable to tear my eyes away from the damage.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bluma was already at his side, her eyes wide with alarm as she examined the burns, moving quickly to check for any deeper injuries.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Yeah, yeah, I'm fine..." Beans winced, trying to shake it off despite the obvious pain. "It just burns." His voice strained, but there was a toughness to it, the kind that suggested he'd faced worse and lived to tell the tale.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I sighed and placed my hand over his arm. A green glow spread from my touch, healing the injury. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Thanks," Beans said, though he winced slightly at the sensation. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"No problem." I smiled, finishing up the healing. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen asked, "Why didn’t it burn you? It touched you when you got scared, right?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I nodded, puzzled. "Yeah, it did touch me. I wonder why it didn’t hurt." Removing my hand from Beans' arm, I added, "There you go, all done." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He tested his arm and chuckled. "Thanks, Deta."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen spotted the jellyfish creature reemerging from the walls. "Let's keep moving before it grabs one of us again," she urged. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We scrambled back up the rocks, noticing the creature moving blindly. When Gwen landed on the other side, she noticed green liquid coating the ground. We stepped through it carefully.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"So, what's the plan now?" Gwen asked, looking at me. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Surprised, I hesitated. "You’re asking me?" She nodded. "Uh... well, we could—Behind you!" I shouted. We turned to see five more jellyfish floating toward us. We all took out our weapons and tried to slowly backup. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"What are these things?" Gwen muttered, drawing her sword. Beans hurled a rock, missing completely. "Nice shot," Gwen deadpanned. Groaning, Beans retrieved his ax.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Watch.." Bluma pointed to where the rock had landed. The jellyfish floated toward it, inspecting it with their tentacles before drifting away. Beans stared, trying to figure it out. Then, a Nu’pul suddenly darted out of the rocks and charged at me. I reacted, striking it with my staff and sending it flying into one of the jellyfish. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The jellyfish wrapped its tentacles around the creature, dissolving it into a mush that was absorbed into the floor leaving a terrible smell in its place. "Ew..." Beans wrinkled his nose.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"> "It looks like they don’t see, they just feel around for anything that’s not a rock," I said. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Gwen rolled her eyes. "So, anything that isn’t a rock is a threat to them. </span><span class="c3">Great, while </span><span class="c0">we die Deta can live here forever."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Gwen, look," I said, pointing as the jellyfish retracted into their gelatinous bodies. "I think they were searching for us, and they mistook that thing for one of us. Now that it's gone..." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen let out a sigh and asked, "So, what does that mean?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I replied with a sigh of my own, "It means this." Raising my hand, I channeled energy into Gwen, causing her to emit a green glow and her skin to transform into a woody texture. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Hey! What are you doing, Bushy?!" she exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Well, if they didn't harm me, and my body is composed of wood, stone, moss, and other elements, I thought that by encasing you guys in wood, we might remain safe as long as we don't provoke them," I explained. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen crossed her arms and reluctantly agreed, "Fine, but if I'm stuck like this, you'll pay for it!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I smiled and turned my attention to Beans, Bluma and passed out Rinn. After a few minutes, Bluma, Gwen, and Beans all had wood-like skin, while Rinn had taken on a stony appearance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Now that we have some protection... the only option I can think of is to make our way towards the exit," I suggested. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Ew! That's gross!" Beans protested, his expression contorted in disgust. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen added, "It's repulsive. No way!" Even Bluma seemed disgusted. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I sighed "Unfortunately, going back the way we came.. does not seem possible, so there's only one way out." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Bluma shook her head, clearly </span><span class="c3">reluctant, but joined me</span><span class="c0">, standing by my side. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Really, Bluma? You're okay with this plan?" Beans asked, surprised and defeated.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Bluma nodded “Yes” She said solemnly to which Beans let out another sigh and joined us, and after a lot of</span><span class="c3"> convincing, Gwen finally agreed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After Bluma picked up Rinn, we began our descent down the giant worm's body, making our way towards its stomach. As we arrived, we witnessed large boulders and small stones being digested. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"This thing actually eats rocks… yay…," I muttered, concern evident in my voice. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen sighed, "Well, this is just great. If we fall in, our disguises will be gone and then we get those stupid jellyfish things." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beans nodded in agreement, and Rinn began to stir. Gwen rolled her eyes as Rinn regained his senses. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"What...?" he murmured, noticing he was slung over Bluma's shoulder like a limp fish. "Excuse me, would you put me down? I don’t need to be carried around like some trophy by a Demon woman!" pushed himself off of Bluma, causing her to stumble to the side.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beans bristled at Rinn’s remark. "How dare you! Bluma saved your life! You should be thanking her, not insulting her!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rinn shrugged dismissively. "Please. I’m not a peasant who worships anyone. And she hardly qualifies for adoration. Demons like her are all the same – complete idiots."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Frustration surged in Beans, his pulse quickening. Bluma straightened her posture, her eyes narrowing at Rinn's words, silently conveying her strength despite the insult. "Hardly qualifies? Bluma is the strongest knight in the land! Her training since childhood has made her an unmatched warrior!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rinn scoffed. "Unmatched? She wouldn’t last a day in the field without help; she couldn’t even beat a child in a real challenge. Her lineage alone disqualifies her from true valor."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beans' fists clenched, anger igniting his words. "You think your heritage defines worth? Bluma could take you down any day! Strength doesn’t just come from blood—it comes from grit and determination!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rinn groaned, uninterested in the exchange. "Her IQ can be easily manipulated. What can a creature like her truly understand about strategy or honor?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beans threw an exasperated hand toward Bluma, who remained silent but resolute. "She’s the smartest woman I know! You’re just scared of her power because it challenges your narrow view of what a knight should be."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That earned him a laugh from Rinn. "If she were so smart, she’d have found a way out of this mess by now. But instead, here she is, carrying a pathetic excuse for a knight."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beans tilted his head, a smirk creeping onto his face. "Have you found a way up yet?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Gwen chuckled at </span><span class="c3">Beans’</span><span class="c0"> retort. “Oh this is gonna be fun” </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I looked to her confused as to how an argument could be fun to watch especially since they seemed like they wanted to kill </span><span class="c3">each other</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Silence fell, and Beans' grin widened. "Bluma isn’t just beautiful; she’s also brilliant. Her scarlet hair and deep eyes reflect her incredible spirit. Years of discipline have sculpted her into a warrior whose very presence commands respect!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rinn crossed his arms, unimpressed. "Beauty is subjective. Physical strength? That's hardly proof of intelligence. I’d take wit over brute force any day. And as for her skills? I've seen nothing that impresses me."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beans’ blood boiled. "You’re just jealous! Bluma's dedication and ingenuity are unmatched. She’s saved lives not just by swinging a sword but by outsmarting foes. She can anticipate moves before they happen!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rinn smirked. "Saving lives just means she can swing a sword. It’s not exactly genius work. Besides, does she really think she’s special? Just another Demon playing at being a knight."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bluma's turned away as she covered her face with on hand getting tired of the argument and looking slightly embarrassed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rinn’s sarcasm dripped from every word. "Oh, how noble. But we live in a world where strength and power reign supreme. A knight’s valor may earn a nod, but it crumbles under true intellect. Her kind has never been known for wisdom."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beans shook his head, fists clenched. "You underestimate the importance of being well-rounded. Bluma proves you don’t have to choose between strength and intelligence. Body and mind can work together, and that’s what makes her extraordinary."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I looked at Gwen again. “Should I do something?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen chuckled and firmly replied. “Nope.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rinn’s smirk returned. "You can keep your idealism. Bluma may swing a sword well enough, but she lacks the depth that true intellect demands. Life is more than following orders and pretending to be a warrior."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beans’ determination surged, fueled by pride for Bluma. "Her courage inspires everyone around her. It’s not just about physical battles; it’s about the battles she fights every day against those who would undermine her."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rinn rolled his eyes, but his expression faltered at the intensity of Beans’ passion. "If you’re so taken with her, why don’t you both get married? Oh, wait. As a Royal Knight, one or both of you would be banished, or even better killed! So why not just give up while you’re ahead?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before Rinn could finish his sentence, Bluma struck him in the neck, causing him to fall unconscious. “Lout..” She said in a hiss like whisper.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen chuckled and looked to the acid lake we had to cross “We could throw him in there-” </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I interrupted her quickly shouting that we would not do that.  After a moment of silence, she spoke up, “Let’s hurry up and get over this ocean of death, hm?” A smile danced on her lips.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I chuckled nervously, knowing that was quite literally true for me. “Yeah... let’s get going.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen took a few steps back and then ran forward, jumping onto the first floating boulder. As she landed, it sank into the water slightly before floating back up. “Whoa,” she exclaimed, trying to maintain her balance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Careful!” I called out, making her roll her eyes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“I know that!” she sighed before leaping to the next boulder. Bluma and Beans followed suit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I stood on the edge, contemplating how badly things could go, and I started shaking. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Hey, Bushy!” I looked up to see Gwen on a platform in the middle. “Get over yourself and get moving over here!”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I took some deep breaths, but my heart raced like a wild animal trapped in my chest. “Mivomafisockmas…” I whispered, trying to steady my breath, yet the taste of fear filled my mouth, leaving it dry and heavy. I stepped back, my gaze fixed on the edge, but the terrifying thought gripped me: If I fell in, I wouldn’t come back out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Deta! Hurry up! It’s starting to rise!” Beans yelled, his voice piercing through the haze of panic. My eyes widened as I turned to see the ominous rise creeping toward me, dark and unyielding. It loomed like a predator, ready to swallow me whole. My instincts screamed at me to run, but terror rooted me in place.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“I can’t do it,” I whispered, my voice barely audible over the pounding in my ears. The ground beneath me felt like it was shifting, each tremor echoing the urgency of the moment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Suddenly, a splash of acid hit my leg, and I screamed, clutching it in agony. The searing pain surged through me, but it only fueled my desperation. “I need to get over there,” I gasped, glancing at the platform where Gwen and the others were safely positioned, their faces a mixture of concern and urgency.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I began cautiously leaping from one boulder to another, making every effort to avoid the corrosive stomach acid that threatened to engulf me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Come on, Deta!” Beans urged, urgency lacing his voice. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Move your butt, Leaf-head!!” Gwen chimed in, her tone a mix of encouragement and impatience.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I nodded in determination and pressed on, successfully reaching the last boulder, which teetered on the edge of disintegration. Barely being able to balance as the ground trembled beneath me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Deta! Jump!” I heard Gwen shout, noticing that the platform they occupied had risen further while the acid level began to recede. Without hesitation, I leaped as high as I could, but I watched in horror as the rock beneath me crumbled away, vanishing into the depths of the acid below.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen reached down, her eyes wide with fear, trying to catch me, but my jump fell agonizingly short. I could see the determination etched on her face, the desperation in her outstretched hand. Time seemed to stretch as I flailed in midair, feeling the weight of the moment crush me. My heart thundered in my chest, drowning out the chaos around me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before I could grasp her fingers, something surged up from the acid—a creature with glimmering golden eyes that seemed to shine like tiny suns amidst the murky depths. Its brown scales glistened, slick and unyielding, as it latched onto me with a grip that felt like iron. Panic flooded my veins as it yanked me downward, the burning liquid swallowing me whole.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">“Deta!!!” </span><span class="c3">Gwen cried out, their voices hauntingly distant </span><span class="c0">as I splashed into the seething abyss.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Holding my breath through the burning pain, I caught sight of an eel-like creature with small golden eyes and brown scales. It clutched me firmly in its mouth, dragging me deeper into the seething depths.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Desperately, I began striking at its eyes, hoping to loosen its grip, but my efforts not only seemed to infuriate it further but more quickly break my body down. It clamped down harder on my torso, causing excruciating pain. Out of pain, I unintentionally inhaled, scorching my insides. Struggling against the creature, the corrosive acid slowly drained my strength, gradually eroding my consciousness.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My mind started to detach from the situation as my thoughts went to Vomete, the Soul Stone, Gwen, and the others. “I’m sorry... I can’t stay awake... much longer...” I murmured in my thoughts. I could feel the Stone so close… but it couldn't do anything.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Just as I began to close my eyes, I noticed two blurry dots approaching from above. One latched onto the eel hitting it with something, causing it to release its hold on me. The other </span><span class="c3">figure was swimming</span><span class="c0"> near me, but before I could discern their identity, my eyes shut.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">When I eventually opened my eyes, a sensation of weightlessness enveloped me. Despite the excruciating pain, I felt an overwhelming sense of peace and happiness. </span><span class="c3 c6">Is... this what death is like? Has my stone shattered? Am I dead...?</span><span class="c0"> Suddenly, a brilliant light materialized to my left. As I gazed toward it, I discerned a woman clad in white robes, radiating a brightness surpassing that of the sun.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Deta... you mustn’t allow them to triumph,” she said, her voice resonating with familiarity. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Intrigued, I inquired, “Triumph? Who will triumph? What do you mean?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The woman’s smile was gentle yet enigmatic. “The council has conspired against you, as such I bestow upon you a second chance... do not squander it. My assistance is limited, for they must remain unaware.” Extending her hand, she intertwined her fingers with mine, and a surge of revitalizing energy coursed through my being.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“What, who are you referring to?” I asked, confused by her words. However, she refused to answer me. Suddenly, a radiant light emerged from behind me, propelling me toward another source of illumination. “Wait, am I dying?” I questioned, my voice filled with trepidation. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The woman chuckled softly. “Quite the opposite.” </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In an instant, my entire field of vision transformed into a blinding white, accompanied by a deafening ringing in my ears. As the ringing subsided, my sight gradually returned, revealing Beans yelling something in my direction while Bluma stood behind him, her hair drenched and acid dripping off her, causing fragments of her bark-like skin melting away like snow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Deta! Can you hear me?" Beans exclaimed, relief flooding his voice. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I managed a faint smile. "Yeah... your voice is loud and clear... mostly loud, though." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">His face lit up with joy as he fell backward onto the ground. "He's alive!" he exclaimed, laughter filling the air. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Suddenly, a surge of intense pain coursed through me like a crashing wave, prompting me to gaze down at my arms, which bore the ravages of the acid. However, a </span><span class="c3">faint</span><span class="c0"> white glow enveloped my body, causing my wounds to regenerate. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With gratitude, I silently thanked the mysterious woman. "Thanks, lady... you're a true lifesaver."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Summoning my strength, I managed to sit up and immediately noticed Gwen's absence. Confusion washed over me as I asked, "Where is Gwen?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Bluma knelt beside me, pointing, where I spotted Gwen sitting next to the colossal and now dead eel, her head buried in her arms. Her drenched black hair covered her face, revealing slightly pointed ears, while her bark-like skin had been completely stripped away. I noticed her sword impaled in the eel's head and many stab wounds, a bit awa</span><span class="c3">y fr</span><span class="c0">om where she sat at the end.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beans let out a sigh. "She kept repeating some strange words when you wouldn't wake up," he explained. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I looked at him intently. "What was it?" I asked, curious to unravel the mystery. Beans took a moment, trying to recall the word. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"I think it was something like... Mivo... miva..." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bluma then chimed in, "Mivomafisockmas." My eyes widened in astonishment. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"She said that?" I was genuinely surprised, not expecting Gwen to remember it. Beans then inquired about its meaning. Letting out a sigh, I responded, "It means... comfort."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I walked over to retrieve Gwen's sword, finding it slightly stuck in the eel's head. After some effort, I managed to pull it free and carried it back to her, settling down beside her. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Silence stretched between us for a few seconds before I spoke softly. "Are you... doing okay, Gwen?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She lifted her head, surprise etching her features. "You're... alive?" I smiled and nodded, only to be sent flying by an unexpectedly powerful punch that made me drop the sword. "What was that for?!" I exclaimed, bewildered by her reaction.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"You could have died!!" Gwen yelled, her voice laced with worry, tears filling her eyes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Defensively, I got up from the floor. "Hey, I didn't want to die!" I protested, confusion and frustration swirling within me which quickly died down upon seeing her tears. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen's voice softened, but the tears still welled in her eyes. "Well, you should have thought of that before you got us involved!" she retorted, the weight of her words resonating with the shared anguish of Beans and Bluma, who now stood nearby, shedding tears of relief.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I turned my gaze back to Gwen, realizing the depth of their care for me. Smiling warmly at Gwen, I reassured her, "Well, I'm not dying again... I promise." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She raised an eyebrow, with a small chuckle and a mix of disbelief and growing amusement on her face. "You're a weird one, Bushy." With that, she picked up her sword, stowed it away, and stood up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Hey, the tree lives!" Gwen said to Beans and Bluma. They exchanged glances, relief washing over their faces before bursting into laughter. I joined in, the air filled with shared joy and gratitude.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But our respite was abruptly cut short as the ground beneath us began to shift, moving us toward the roof. "What's going on!?" Beans exclaimed, confusion and worry creeping into his voice. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I scanned our surroundings, desperately trying to make sense of the situation. My eyes landed on a hole slowly opening near the roof. Realization struck me. "Guys... we're inside the stomach. Where does food go after being digested?!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We exchanged concerned glances, and Gwen voiced our collective thought, "Well... this was supposed to be our way out, right?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I smiled uncomfortably, the gravity of our predicament sinking in. "Yeah... but um..." I glanced at the lifeless eel before us. "Everyone, help me move the eel!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"What do you think you're doing, Bushy?" Gwen asked, confusion etched on her face as she and the others rushed over. "If we angle its head, it can slide down easier." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The eel's head proved quite heavy, but with Gwen's assistance, we managed to maneuver it. Beans joined us, skepticism and concern flickering in his eyes. "How does helping the thing poop better help us?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I met his gaze and replied, "Better than yall being drained of your juices”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At that point everyone agreed to get into the eel, throwing Rinns passed out body first. Once inside the floor began to rise towards the top of the stomach.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"> “This may feel tight,” I warned.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The hole near the roof widened, and as the eel's body then pressed against the ceiling of the worm's stomach, it began sliding toward the opening. It dropped on the other side, hitting the ground with a thud and quickly drying up, causing its skin to become brittle and breakable. One by one, we emerged from inside the eel, greeted by a chorus of disgusted exclamations. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen crawled out of the eel's mouth, holding her arms in disgust.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Gross!" Beans yelled, having tasted some eel gut. Bluma carefully dragged Rinn out and set him down on the ground, her expression weary, and I followed suit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Bushy, after this, I am never going back inside another creature!" Gwen declared, her tone a mixture of exasperation and determination.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I chuckled, attempting to lighten the mood. "I swear, we're done with this after today." However, as I surveyed our new surroundings, my heart sank. We found ourselves in another vast and cavernous chamber within the colossal purple worm.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"You've got to be kidding me... we're still not out?" Beans groaned, frustration evident in his voice. He walked over to the lifeless eel, ripped out a rib bone, and flung it away in irritation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The bone soared through the air, landing behind a large mound of brown matter and producing a faint chime upon impact. Beans and I exchanged intrigued glances and ventured closer to investigate. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen, with a mix of reluctance and curiosity, questioned our actions. "What are you two idiots doing?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I paused and turned back to her. "We heard something behind that pile and wanted to see what it was."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen appeared as though she wanted to argue, but she rubbed her eyes and sighed. "Alright, whatever. Be careful, alright?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I smiled and nodded in agreement. </span><span class="c0">Then Beans let out a cry, I hurried over to see what had happened, fearing something bad had occurred.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Beans, what is it? Is something wrong?" I turned the corner to find him clutching three gems. "I found elemental stones! I have to show Bluma!" Without wasting a moment, he darted off to show her and Gwen. I chuckled and glanced back, only to spot a skeleton holding an open box.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just as I was about to walk away I felt a wave of energy shoot out of the box, the energy caused me to pause for a moment. “There is no way..” I muttered. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Slowly making my way to the wooden box. I then, with caution, removed the box from the skeletons hands and just as I was about to open it, I could feel an intense heat from my side, looking towards it I caught sight of a pillar of fire hurtling toward me. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"What the heck?!" I swiftly leaped out of harm's way, narrowly avoiding the flames and the large brown mound.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Glancing back at where the pillar came from, I was surprised to see Gwen wearing a broad smile, a gem now adorning her sword's blade. "This is awesome!" she exclaimed, laughing. "You're not so bad after all, Dwarf!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen then turned and noticed me on the ground. "Why are you lying on the floor, Bushy?" I got back up and walked over to her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I retorted as I tried to stand up "Because I nearly got set on fire! What was that?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Gwen grinned. "The stones Beans brought gave my sword enchantments." Her </span><span class="c3">sword</span><span class="c0"> now glowed white and as she swung it around fire followed it through the air.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I smiled nervously, considering the newfound powers she possessed. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beans couldn't help but chuckle at the show "And there's a blue and white gem! They represent water and air magic, respectively. These gems are some of the rarest in the world!" Beans stowed the remaining two gems in his pouch. "I'm going to hold onto them!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen looked to Beans excitedly “Oh! You gotta let me try those out!”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Panicked that Gwen might summon a tornado inside, I cut her off before she could reach the stones. “Well how about we wait till we are all back home huh?” </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Meanwhile, next to the eel, Rinn slowly sat up and surveyed his surroundings. "Where... Where in the nine realms are we?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen responded quick and blunt. "We're in the worm's butt."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">His face twisted in disgust. "The indignity..." Standing up, he noticed that his cuffs had turned green. "Who has done this? I refuse to become someone's slave! It's an abomination!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Upon hearing this Gwen couldn't contain her laughter. "I find it quite fitting for you!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I sighed apologetically. "Sorry, Rinn. We don't know who did this."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He rolled his eyes in disbelief. "Unbelievable... A slave who doesn't even get to know their master… you're all useless.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I walked over to Rinn with an awkward smile “Well I might not be so bad, right?” </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rinn growled “Just shut-” </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">He flung his hand to slap me and</span><span class="c3"> I flinched</span><span class="c0">, dropping the box, but after not feeling the impact I glanced at him only to notice a glowing chain around his arm tightened keeping him from making contact with me. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rinn’s face then dropped “No… you can't be serious.”</span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr/><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><h5 class="c7 c23" id="h.3j2qqm3"><span class="c21">CHAPTER 17 </span><span class="c13 c8">                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Away from Council Eyes</span></h5><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Gwen burst into laughter—loud and wild—as she strolled over to Rinn’s crumpled form. Without a hint of warning, she scooped him up and tossed him in my direction like a rag doll.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Looks like Bushy here is your master!” she cackled, nearly doubling over. “Oh, this is hilarious!”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Rinn scrambled upright, his movements stiff and full of disbelief. “Impossible!” he barked. “This creature has no idea how to claim a slave! And I highly doubt he would ever have the courage to do so!”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I took a step back, my heart starting to pound. “Wait, hold on! I don’t want to own anyone! This has to be a misunderstanding!”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Gwen sighed, grinning. “Listen, Bushy, whether you like it or not, you now own him. And besides, it’s just seven years of his life.” She let out another chuckle like it was no big deal.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Rinn pushed himself fully to his feet, strands of his silvery hair falling over his face. His eyes dropped to the faint glow of the chains around his wrists… and I saw it—the shimmer beginning to vanish, fading into nothing like smoke in the air.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">My stomach sank. So it was real.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">He looked at me then. Not startled. Not afraid. Just quiet. Watching. The tension in his jaw eased, and slowly, he reached up to smooth his hair back into place. Then… he smiled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">It wasn’t a friendly smile. There was something smug in it—like he’d figured something out that the rest of us hadn’t.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I turned to Gwen, lowering my voice. “This really sucks... There has to be a way to break this.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">She rolled her eyes like I’d asked the dumbest question in the world. “Like I said, no. Just give him to Bluma once we’re out, and she can handle him if you don’t want to deal with him.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">That’s when I noticed him moving again—walking slowly toward us with the kind of calm that made my skin crawl.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">“Well, congratulations,” Rinn said, voice light but sharp. “It seems I am unable to cause you any harm, young creature…” He gave a low chuckle. “But don’t think for a second that this grants you dominion over me.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I tensed as he advanced on me. Just before he could get too close, Gwen stepped between us, her hand raised as a warning. “Listen here, you better not play any of your cruel mind games on him, or else…”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before she could finish her threat, Rinn moved with frightening speed. His hand struck the side of her neck, hitting a nerve, and Gwen’s body went slack, her eyes rolling back as she collapsed to the ground, unconscious.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Piece of trash,” Rinn muttered with a dark chuckle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bluma and Beans reacted instantly, weapons ready, expressions full of fury. “Why, you—!” Beans growled, gripping his axe tightly, but I raised my hand, signaling him to stop.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Leave him be, Beans…”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beans looked at me like I’d lost my mind. “Are you crazy? He attacked one of us!” He gripped his axe tighter, his knuckles white, but I didn’t waver. I moved toward Rinn instead.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rinn chuckled at my approach, but before he could say another word, I grabbed him by the throat, lifting him off the ground effortlessly. His eyes widened in surprise.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Do you not remember what I told you, Rinn…” I growled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As he gasped for air, I spoke low, my voice laced with a threat. “If you say or do one more thing to Gwen, I will make you pay.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rinn struggled in my grip, but I could see the panic in his eyes as shackles appeared on his wrists, draining his strength.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Deta!” Bluma shouted in shock.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beans echoed, confusion and disbelief in his voice. “Deta! What are you doing!”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The voices of my friends felt muffled, distant—like they were calling to me from underwater. A cold, dark voice slithered into my ear, its tone insistent. “</span><span class="c3 c6">He broke her once... he'll do worse next time…</span><span class="c0">”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I tossed Rinn to the ground, his chest heaving as he gasped for air. He struggled to stand, his strength returning slowly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Get up, Rinn...” I glared at him, my voice dripping with malice. “You said I was no Randeth... Why don’t we prove what I am?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rinn stood, coughing, a twisted grin spreading across his face. “A spare...? Very well.” He adjusted his posture, his voice chilling as he continued. “If you win, I will do as you say... No questions asked. But if I win, we trade… you become my slave.”</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Beans’ eyes widened in disbelief. “Deta, don’t! He isn’t worth it!”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bluma, realizing her words were failing to reach me, drew her sword and advanced toward us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The voice inside my head came again, its tone darker now. </span><span class="c3 c8 c6">“They will get in the way. Make them stay still. It's for their own good... for their safety.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Without thinking, my hand shot up, and vines began to wrap around Gwen, Bluma, and Beans, pinning them in place.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Deta, stop! What’s gotten into you?” Beans cried out as he struggled against the vines, but they held firm, his efforts futile.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c8 c6">"You’re not hurting them. You’re protecting them—from him."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rinn’s smile twisted, darker than before. “Do we have a deal?” His voice was low, almost a hiss.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I responded, my voice cold. “Deal.” The word tasted wrong on my tongue, like a curse whispered from the deepest corners of the world.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A low, eerie chuckle echoed—one from Rinn, the other from somewhere much darker—as we took sixteen paces away from each other, the tension thick in the air.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rinn’s gaze flicked to a human skeleton lying forgotten in the dirt. He reached for it, curling his fingers around the ribcage and arm bone, lifting the makeshift weapon with a grin that sent a chill down my spine. “This will do nicely,” he muttered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We turned to face each other. My body was coiled, every fiber prepared for the clash to come.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c6">“Now. Before he strikes again. Run him through...</span><span class="c0"> the voice ordered, cold and unrelenting. It was no longer my will. My body moved on its own, my heart pounding with a brutal purpose: to end him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rinn chuckled darkly, his fingers flicking over the ribcage like a twisted musician. The eerie sound of bone striking bone filled the air, sharp and haunting. A strange, hollow tune—broken and frantic—echoed around us. It was as if the very bones protested against the music.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Straightforward, young creature,” Rinn taunted, his hands moving with precision. A sharp, piercing high note rang out, and a shockwave of energy slammed into me, knocking me back, rattling my body.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A second wave struck like a cannon blast, lifting me off the ground and hurling me through the air. The world spun, sound warping, but I twisted mid-flight and crashed down—hard—on all fours. My hooves struck the earth with a thunderous crack. Fury surged through me, molten and pure, washing away everything else.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then I felt it—deep in my core, something ancient answering the call. My limbs rippled and split. Minerals surged to the surface of my skin with a sound like breaking geodes, shards of stone snapping into place as my shape twisted and reformed. Moss erupted across my back like wildfire, wrapping me in its verdant grasp. Iron ore gleamed along my antlers, branching wide like living blades.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">His music fell silent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A hush dropped over the battlefield, heavy and reverent, as if the land itself was holding its breath.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beans and Bluma stared, wide-eyed, unable to hide their disbelief.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“You’re actually a... a Randeth…” Rinn’s voice faltered, his composure slipping for a moment as the reality of my transformation hit him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I charged forward, my hooves pounding against the earth, sending tremors through the ground. Rinn’s eyes went wide in panic. He threw his hands over the bones, desperate to play faster. The hollow sound became a frantic blur, each note growing more erratic.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When he struck the high note again, the shockwave had no effect on me. I barreled forward, unstoppable.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rinn leaped to the side, narrowly avoiding my antlers. But he wasn’t finished. He struck three low notes, sending glowing blue projectiles hurtling toward me. They hit with a thunderous crash, sending me stumbling back, rocks and moss flying from my elk form.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fury surged within me, and I readied myself to charge again. But then, two swords materialized in front of me—Gwen and Bluma, standing between us with their weapons raised.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c6">“Get them out of the way. Kill them. Now!”</span><span class="c0"> The voice screamed in my mind.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">I stomped my hooves, signaling for them to move, but Gwen and Bluma stood firm, their eyes unyielding.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bluma spoke first, her voice calm but commanding. “Stop.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen didn’t budge. Her sword was held steady, her eyes fierce. “Bushy, quit it already! Killing him is my job!”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The voice in my mind howled, louder than ever. </span><span class="c3 c8 c6">“Kill the girl!”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">A searing jolt tore through my ear, sharp and sudden, like a hook being yanked from inside my skull. It wasn’t pain I knew; it was worse. Foreign. Crawling. </span><span class="c3 c6">Wrong.</span><span class="c0"> The haze cracked. I staggered, reeling, and shook my head in panic. The sensation only grew—twisting deeper, thrashing like something alive.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, with a sickening Thwip, a small, white worm-like creature fell from my ear, landing at Bluma’s feet with a soft plop.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before I could react, Bluma crushed it beneath her foot with a swift, decisive motion. The parasite’s existence was extinguished in an instant.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The battlefield fell silent. The voice inside my head, once so commanding, was now eerily quiet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I slowly transformed back into my normal form, staring at Gwen, Bluma, and a terrified Rinn. Beans, still caught in the vines, watched in concern. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Bushy...?" Gwen took a step towards me, but I sharply turned around and took a step back. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"I... I didn't mean to..." I whispered, then turned and ran away. Gwen chased after me, trying to catch up, but we soon found ourselves in a closed area with no clear escape route. Grabbing the box with the soul stone as I did so.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Suddenly, the walls began closing in, and a hole with a bright light appeared on the other side of the room where I was headed. Gwen sprinted towards me, while Bluma rescued Rinn and freed Beans from the vines. "Bushy! Stop!" Gwen called out, running faster to catch up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I kept running, consumed by fear and panic, now knowing what I was capable of. </span><span class="c3 c6">I was going to kill him! I'm being consumed by the fire! Vomete, help me!</span><span class="c0"> I thought to myself, my mind filled with despair.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As I approached the opening in the abdominal wall, a bright light radiated from the other side. It seemed like a way to escape and keep them safe from my destructive potential. I ran towards it, driven by the desperate need to protect them from myself. Gwen, determined to prevent me from fleeing, called out, "Leaf head! Mivomafisockmas!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I hesitated, slowing my pace. </span><span class="c3 c6">Miv- Why would... She can't possibly be telling me I'm okay. There is no way, she must be lying!</span><span class="c0"> I battled with conflicting thoughts holding tightly to the box.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen groaned, desperately trying to catch up. "Don't you dare try to get away, you Bush!" I saw that the hole had widened enough for me to jump through. With all the strength I could muster, I increased my speed, putting distance between us, and leaped through the opening. As I emerged on the other side, a blinding white light enveloped my vision, and everything turned white.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Once the light faded and I could see, I saw beneath me trees and grass, but that was beneath me as I realized I was now falling off the side of the giant purple worm.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With little time to react, I curled into a fetal position, bracing myself for a hard impact. However, instead of crashing into the ground, I landed on something soft and squishy. Confused, I looked around and saw that I had fallen onto a gray liquid resembling a wet rock. As I tried to stand up, the liquid started to move, causing me to slip and tumble face-first onto it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Realizing I had landed on a creature, I quickly apologized, hoping it would understand. However, it didn't respond and slowly made its way out from under me, disappearing into the bushes. I apologized once more, and then looked up at the exposed spot on the forest's canopy. "Well... at least I'm out now," I murmured to myself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I walked out of the woods and saw the giant purple worm's body sinking back into the ground. Looking up at the tip of its end, I spotted the hole I had jumped through and noticed Gwen and the others emerging as well. It seemed Gwen had seen me at the same time, as her first words upon landing were spoken with anger in a language I couldn't understand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen's eyes locked onto me, and in the next heartbeat, she was sprinting toward me with laser-focused determination. Panic surged through me as I tried to flee, but my limbs were too slow. With a surge of force, she leaped, grabbing hold of me, and we both crashed to the ground in a tangled heap. The soul stone slipped from my fingers and rolled away.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Don’t you dare run!" she snapped, her voice fierce as she straddled my torso and pinned my arms to the ground. "Why in the blazes did you start running off, huh?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Struggling beneath her weight, I gasped for breath, trying to find words. "I didn’t—!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But before I could explain, she cut me off, her frustration boiling over. "You didn’t what!? Did you think I was going to kill you!?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The force of her words hit me like a slap. I froze, stunned by the accusation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"No! Not at all, I just—" I stammered, but her anger cut me off again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Just what!?" she demanded, her voice sharp, rising in both frustration and concern.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I clenched my jaw, trying to steady myself. The words were clawing at my throat. Before I could stop myself, I shouted, "I didn’t want to kill you!" It was the first time I had ever raised my voice, and the shock of it seemed to catch her off guard, leaving me a fleeting moment to gather my thoughts.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"I was angry!" I continued, the words tumbling out like a dam breaking. "I couldn’t think straight, and I just wanted to hurt him! And then when you stepped in front of me, I heard these voices, telling me to hurt you, to kill you! Do you think I wanted that?!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My chest heaved, each breath ragged, waiting for her to respond, but she was silent, her eyes searching mine, conflicted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"I don’t hurt things," I whispered, voice trembling. "I’m a coward—I’m afraid... I just wanted to be left alone in the woods, to live peacefully. I only want to keep the people I care about safe. But if I hurt one of you... I could never forgive myself."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The silence hung between us, thick and heavy, before she slowly released my arms and pushed herself off me. She stepped back, her expression unreadable.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bluma, Beans, and Rinn approached, their footsteps soft on the ground, but I barely noticed them. Gwen didn’t look back at me as she moved, refusing to let me view her face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Deta! Why did you run off!? Are you alright?" Beans asked, concerned, while Bluma and Rinn slowed down. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Once they stopped Rinn stood back with his arms crossed, leaning against a tree, while Bluma and Beans helped me up and checked if I was alright. Gwen, on the other hand, began to walk into some bushes. Beans turned and saw her walking off, "Gwen? Where are you going?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen stopped and without turning responded, "I'm going to clear my head." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rinn smiled, "Good luck..." Gwen growled at his snarky remark but simply turned away and disappeared into the brush.</span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16 c8 c6 c17">Gwen’s View</span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c3 c8 c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After trudging through the forest for what felt like forever, I finally stumbled upon a lazy little stream. The kind of place you'd find in a painting or something. Birds flitted down from the trees, splashing around like it was bath time, while fish darted under the water, living their carefree lives. A big rock jutted halfway into the stream, and it looked like as good a spot as any to sit and stew.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I climbed onto it, letting out a deep sigh that felt like it should’ve shaken the trees around me. My gaze wandered to the sky, all bright and clear, but my mind wasn’t anywhere close to peaceful. Deta’s stupid retort kept bouncing around in my head like an annoying fly. </span><span class="c3 c6">Deta…</span><span class="c0"> I grabbed a handful of pebbles and chucked them into the water, watching the ripples erase the reflection of my scowl.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Why would he even... Why does he care?” My voice sounded small, even to me. The reflection staring back wasn’t much better—just a filthy, bloodstained, mud-caked mess. Dried stomach juice? Yeah, that too. I’d stopped counting how many days we were trapped. Three? Four? Too long.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The clouds above didn’t care, floating all carefree and fluffy. I flopped back on the rock, trying to let the sky take my thoughts, but peace never lasted long these days. A crack—the sharp snap of wood—echoed through the trees.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I bolted upright, every nerve on high alert. More snapping followed, closer this time, and I slid off the boulder, sword at the ready. My boots splashed quietly through the stream as I crept toward the noise.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Something floated in the water—burnt wood, still smoldering. My stomach clenched.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then I saw it. A house. No... several houses, or what was left of them, scattered like toys dropped by some careless giant.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I stepped out of the stream, scanning the wreckage. My foot landed on a branch, and the crack it made seemed louder than thunder. I froze, heart hammering, as rustling came from one of the houses.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Who’s out there?” A sharp, gruff voice cut through the silence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before I could think of an answer, a goblin stomped out, a rusted sword in hand. He squinted at the woods like he owned them. My hand went to my sword hilt, ready to strike, when another voice—a small, piping one—made him pause.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“What’s wrong, Daddy?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A little goblin girl peeked out from the doorway. The sight made my chest tighten, though I wasn’t sure why.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Nothing, sweet pea. Go back inside with your mother.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She obeyed, casting a quick glance over her shoulder before disappearing. The goblin man muttered something about adventurers and loot as he shuffled toward the stream. He didn’t even notice me until he turned around—and found my blade inches from his throat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I crouched to his level, finger pressed to my lips. “Shh. I won’t kill you. Your little girl needs a father.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">His whole body shook, sweat glistening on his green skin. “W-What do you want?” His voice cracked like dry wood, heavy with fear.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I pressed the blade just enough to remind him who had the upper hand. “You’re clever. Take a wild guess.”</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16 c8 c6 c17">Deta’s View</span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c3 c8 c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">An awkward silence hung over everyone after what had just happened inside the worm, and hearing what went through my head.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beans was the first to break the silence. “So... what are you going to do once we all get back to the kingdom?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bluma didn’t answer, just sat there still as stone, eyes locked on Rinn but listening closely.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I let out a breath and rubbed the back of my neck. “Well… I’m not really sure. I got what I came out for, so… probably head home?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rinn tilted his head, that usual edge in his voice creeping back in. “Unsure? What does that mean?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I looked over at Rinn and replied, "Well, I don't know. I have a lot to think about right now." Rinn sighed, looking displeased with the answer, but said nothing further. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I then saw the Soul Stone lying on the ground under a bush near Rinn’s feet, I panicked realizing I dropped it and bent down and quickly grabbed it before Rinn could see what it was.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I then turned to Beans and asked, "What about you and Bluma? Are you both going back and getting married or something?" Beans choked on air, and Bluma went more red as she turned away and put her hand to her forehead. Rinn burst into laughter as the two fell silent. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"W-well, you see, Deta. We couldn't even if we wanted to. If," Beans explained. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I tilted my head and asked, "What do you mean?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beans sighed and continued, "You see, as a squire, I can't pursue Bluma in public. She is my boss, and if we were to see each other in that sense, we would both lose everything."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was taken aback and commented, "Lose everything? That seems extreme, don't you think?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beans sighed and replied, "If I were a knight, that would be fine, but if we are caught together, then Bluma would lose her Knight ranking and be banished back to her home, and I would be banished from the land. We would never see each other again. Plus, she is the Queen's knight... and she isn't the friendliest of people." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I chuckled and said, "Yeah, I could tell... but I understand." I didn't fully understand, but I didn't want to push too far.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rinn sighed and whispered to himself, "Adventures four... coming to a close." He then got onto the ground to sit, and something rustled in the nearby bushes. We all looked, expecting Gwen, only to see a small goblin emerge. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beans and Bluma drew out their weapons and readied for a fight. The goblin put up his hands and whimpered out “Wait! Please, do you know a girl named Gwen?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hearing her name, I spoke up. "Yeah, we know her. Is something wrong?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The goblin smiled and replied, "She told me to tell you to: “move your butts and follow me.” He then turned around and walked back into the shrubbery. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was about to follow when Beans stopped me.  "Deta, it's a goblin. They are always up to something." I looked at Beans, then at the brush, and then back. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Then we'll be careful. But we can't afford to lose someone now, after we've made it this far."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beans sighed and glanced at Bluma, who nodded in agreement. Then four of us followed the small goblin to the stream. I asked, "So, how do you know Gwen?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The goblin sarcastically responded, "Oh, we went to wizarding school together! What do you think? She put a sword to my neck!" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I sighed and said, "That sounds like her... sorry."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The goblin waved dismissively and groaned, "Ah, whatever. She offered to fix my house if I let you all stay for the night."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This surprised all of us. Gwen, helping someone like that? Was she sick? Was she suffering from some kind of brain dysfunction? We exchanged confused and concerned looks. I asked, "Are you sure it's our Gwen?" Before the goblin could respond, a voice called out from across the stream. We then saw Gwen, balancing a pile of wood on one shoulder and a little goblin girl on the other.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen then noticed us and went to say something but then her smile faltered, and she resumed walking. "Hurry up, you four. It's almost dark." As we looked up we saw a growing night sky scattered with emerging stars. By the time we entered the goblin family's small home, we managed to find just enough floor space to settle down. After putting his daughter to sleep, the goblin father carefully stepped over the sleeping forms of Bluma, Beans, and Rinn before heading out the door.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I found myself sitting outside, leaning against the wall, lost in thought. The door creaked open, and the goblin father stepped out, noticing me. "It's late, Rocko. You should get some shut-eye," he said, his tone kind but firm.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I smiled at him. "Well, why aren't you in bed?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He chuckled. "I'm on guard duty tonight. I'll get some sleep later, but you won't be staying here another night, so you'd better take advantage of the rest."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We both laughed softly. "Alright, alright, I'll head in soon," I said. He rolled his eyes playfully. "Sure you will," he teased before walking off into the shadows.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I stayed where I was, staring at the ground, my thoughts tangled. Suddenly, Gwen's voice broke the silence from above. I glanced up and saw her perched on the roof, peering down at me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Oh, hey, Gwen," I greeted with a faint smile as she hopped down, her armor clinking softly. She wasted no time. "Answer the question, Deta. Do you think you're a wimp?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her bluntness caught me off guard. I hesitated, then looked away. "Yeah, I'm scared. I know you think that's pathetic."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She plopped down in front of me, her tone laced with sarcasm. "Oh yeah, sure, because only a scaredy-cat runs into a cave to save his friend."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I blinked, surprised. "Hold on—"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She raised a hand to silence me. "I'm not finished. Only a scaredy-cat risks his life for three people he barely knows. Only a scaredy-cat saves a slave from her prison. Do you hear yourself?" Her voice rose slightly, careful not to wake the others but insistent all the same.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"You've done at least twenty things in the past few days that most people would run from. You've tried to keep us safe this whole trip... You were even ready to kill Rinn for hitting me!" Her words hit me hard, and I found myself staring at the ground as the truth sank in.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"You're right," I murmured.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">She scoffed. "Of course I’m right! Bushy, you’re brave </span><span class="c3 c6">because</span><span class="c0"> you’re scared. Fear motivates you to do better, and you’ve kept doing that. Don’t you dare stop now. You hear me?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I smiled faintly, meeting her eyes. "Thanks, Gwen." The leaves that made up my hair had closed for the night, revealing the network of vines underneath. She looked away, her face slightly flushed. "Tch, don’t look at me like that," she muttered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Like what?" I asked, confused.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Doesn’t matter. Just get your butt to bed. I need some sleep." She yawned and stood, heading back inside.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Geez, Gwen. So pushy," I chuckled as I stood up and glanced at the sky. The stars twinkled above as I whispered, "I don’t know why you saved me, but I hope I did something right." With a sigh, I followed her inside.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16 c8 c6 c17">Queen’s View</span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c3 c8 c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The princess had fallen asleep in her father’s lap, her small frame rising and falling with each peaceful breath. My husband’s face softened as he looked down at her, and he spoke in a hushed tone, his love for her evident in every word. “Oh, my dear sweet flower... it seems you’ve exhausted yourself this evening.” He rose carefully, cradling her in his arms as though she were the most fragile thing in the world. Turning to me, his expression was warm and adoring, the kind of gaze he always gave me but one I no longer returned.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“My dear,” he said, his voice filled with affection, “I’m going to put our little girl to bed. I’ll join you in our chambers in a moment.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I forced a soft smile, the one he expected from me. “Of course, my king. I’ll see you there.” My tone was sweet, bordering on syrupy. It was effortless to feign love for him; after all, he never noticed the sharp edges beneath my words. He leaned in, and I allowed the briefest kiss, keeping my expression tender.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As he carried our daughter out of the room, I let the smile fall away the moment his back was turned. My eyes drifted toward the staircase ahead of me. My steps were unhurried, and though the stone beneath my feet gleamed as it shifted to polished metal, mimicking the night sky, I felt no awe. It was all just a means to an end—a spectacle meant to impress, but not me. I had long since stopped being impressed by such things.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The gilded door at the top of the stairs came into view, its crystal handle catching the faint glow of the sconces lining the walls. I opened it with practiced calm, stepping into the chamber where seven figures waited. Their cloaks of light glimmered, their ethereal forms looming high above. They always tried to present themselves as beings of wisdom and power, but to me, they were nothing more than tools to be used.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They spoke amongst themselves as I entered, their voices overlapping in discussion. The eldest of them was the first to speak clearly, his tone laced with authority. “Brothers, the time draws near when the Lord shall return among us. And when he does, we shall surely fall.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I lingered at the edge of the room, feigning patience as the others responded. Their talk of celestial orders and impending doom was predictable, the same song and dance they always performed. When the third spoke of surrendering to divine will, I grew tired of their chatter. Clearing my throat, I interrupted their sanctimonious musings.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Am I interrupting something, gentlemen?” I asked, tilting my head with mock innocence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The eldest raised a glowing hand in acknowledgment. “No worries, child. We, being in good spirits, have summoned you here to entrust you with a task.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I let out a quiet sigh, rolling my eyes where they couldn’t see. “Well then, what is it you want this time?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One of the younger six spoke, his voice trembling slightly as though he feared to offend. “The Lord has been spotted once again in your kingdom called Earth. We request that you eliminate him.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That piqued my interest. I placed a hand on my hip, feigning curiosity. “Eliminate him? Interesting. Why must I kill this so-called Lord?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The question provoked an immediate reaction. Their cloaks glowed red, and the eldest snapped, “He is no ordinary man! He will disrupt our celestial order and bring destruction upon all!”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I suppressed a smirk. The sight of their outrage always amused me. Another voice,The youngest of the seven, his voice soft yet resolute, spoke up from the edge of their circle. “Elder Brethren, it’s folly to speak ill of one who carries a pure heart. I beg ye, remember the oath we swore—to restore what was lost, once he earns forgiveness. He stands just and righteous.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The eldest’s gaze cut through him like a blade, eyes cold as frozen stone. His lips curled in something close to disdain, and his voice, when it came, was dripping with condescension. “Oh, little brother...” His tone dripped with mockery, as though he were addressing a toddler. “We’ll not have our counsel disrupted by the prattling of a mere boy.” His voice grew louder, deeper, and the very walls seemed to shudder with his words. “You would dare lecture us on righteousness? I’d sooner listen to the wind’s gossip.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With a snap of his fingers, the air around him seemed to tighten, and his next words boomed with the force of a storm. “Enough!” The sheer power of his voice sent me crashing backward, my body slamming into the door. My skull met the hard wood with a sickening thud, and I tasted the bitter sting of my own frustration, yet I could hardly find space for pain in the fury rising within me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Excuse me,” I said sharply, sitting upright. “Mind your temper. We are not all deities here.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The eldest turned back to me, his tone tempered but still dripping with authority. “Ah yes, my apologies, child. We will not detain you longer than necessary.” A red orb materialized in his hands, descending slowly toward me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“This is a beast of fire and brimstone. We entrust you with the power to bring your cause to reality and destroy our enemies,” he intoned.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I reached for the orb, only to hiss in pain as it burned my skin. Before I could speak, it shifted into a bracelet, its beads glinting with a sinister light and a rhombus-shaped crystal at its center. The sight of it intrigued me, though I kept my expression neutral.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“It shall be at your beck and call. Now, go,” the eldest commanded.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The room dissolved into white light, and when my vision returned, I was back in my chambers, seated on the bed. The bracelet glinted on my wrist, a tangible reminder of the power now within my grasp. A quiet laugh escaped me, cold and sharp. “Finally,” I murmured to myself. “Now, my goals are within close reach.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The door opened, and my husband entered, his face lighting up as he saw me. “Sorry for the wait, my love,” he said, crossing the room with an easy smile.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I masked my disdain with a warm expression, watching as he changed into his nightclothes. “No worries, love. No worries at all,” I replied sweetly, lying back against the pillows.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As he joined me, the faint tremors that had plagued the castle for days returned. He sighed, his brow furrowing. “The shaking hasn’t ceased for four days now. I hope Deta and his comrades are surviving.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Feigning concern, I placed a hand over his. “I’m sure they are safe. You mustn’t worry yourself over such things,” I said, my tone soft and reassuring.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“What if it were me down there? Or our daughter?” he pressed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I paused for effect, then smiled gently. “They are safe. I’m certain of it.” I touched his cheek, letting my fingers linger. “Now... shall we enjoy the rest of our night without fretting over the kingdom?” My voice was light, playful, the perfect mask.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">He chuckled, pulling me close, and I let him. He never saw the frost behind the warmth of my smile. He never would.</span><hr/></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><h5 class="c7 c23" id="h.1y810tw"><span class="c21">CHAPTER 18</span><span class="c32">                                                                                                                                An old story          </span><span class="c42 c8 c45 c22">                                                                                                </span></h5><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The next day, we gathered our belongings and expressed our gratitude to the Goblin family for their hospitality.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Thank you so much! Is there anything we can do for you before we leave?" I asked the Goblin father.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">He let out a laugh that sounded like a woodpecker hammering away at a tree. </span><span class="c0">"Don’t worry about it. And please, call me Nox. Now get out of our town before I change my mind!" he exclaimed with a grin.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen rolled her eyes but kept a sly smile. "Yeah, yeah, whatever." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">She turned to me, and I nodded in agreement. </span><span class="c3 c6">The sooner we leave, the sooner I can get back to Vomete</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just as Gwen and I started walking, Beans chimed in, "So, Nox, do you know where the Sumring Palace is?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Both Gwen and I halted abruptly, realizing we had no idea where we were. Rinn chuckled, clearly amused by our sudden stop, but his expression shifted when he looked and saw Nox's little girl who was grabbing his hair and playing with it. After a brief, awkward silence, </span><span class="c3">he sighed and averted his gaze</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Nox cackled. "Sumring, huh? </span><span class="c3">Planning on invading it?</span><span class="c0">"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">His comment startled both Beans and Bluma. Neither responded, so Nox continued, "It’s on the other side of the mountains."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Mountains? What mountains?" I asked, confused. I didn’t recall seeing any the night before.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With a small chuckle, Gwen placed her hand on my head and turned it to face a massive mountain range beyond the forest. The peaks were dark gray, their jagged edges cutting into the pale morning sky. They loomed silently, blending so perfectly with the haze that it felt as though the sky itself had folded down to swallow them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Oh… those," I muttered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nox laughed at my delayed perception. "Yeah, those ones—Spearhead Heights."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rinn’s demeanor shifted, and he stood up straight, surprised by Nox’s words. "You mean you’re sending us to the Shadowspine Tunnels?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beans groaned. "You’re kidding, right? Those are a death trap!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I turned to Gwen. "What’s wrong with the caves?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She groaned and sighed. "They’re like a maze. Dead ends, ruins, endless halls—there’s even a drop to the Underworld..."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The mention of the Underworld sent a shiver through me. I definitely didn’t want to go back there, but I needed to get home.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Is there any other way, Nox?" I asked hopefully.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nox shook his head. "Not unless you want to walk around, but good luck with that. If that range is the only thing keeping Mount Tarifa from invading, how much luck do you think you’ll have?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rinn nodded. "We’ll be fine. I’ve traveled through once before—"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen cut him off with a sharp growl. "Like we’d trust you to lead? You’re just looking for a way out of your chains."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rinn narrowed his eyes and raised his arm, the glowing green chain appearing briefly. "Unlike you were," he retorted. "I’m not delusional about my escape."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen reached for her sword, but Nox interrupted with a yell. "Hey! Quiet down in front of my house! I helped you—now get out!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Snarling one last time, Gwen let go of her sword and stomped off. "Let’s go, Leaf-head." She grabbed my collar and yanked me forward.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"I’m coming! You don’t have to pull so hard!" I protested, trying not to trip over my feet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Rinn groaned as the green chain tugged him forward, forcing him to follow. It faded again as Beans and Bluma led the way into the woods toward Spearhead Heights. </span><span class="c2">I turned to see Rinn trailing behind, his hands stuffed in his pockets. Then I looked at Gwen, walking beside me. She avoided both my gaze and Rinn’s, her hair bouncing with each step, catching patches of sunlight.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“So, Gwen… about last night—” I began, but she cut me off sharply.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Don’t mention it. Really, don’t,” she said, giving me a sidelong glance. Her deep blue eyes seemed to gleam in the fleeting sunlight. “And stop looking at me like that. You’re weirding me out.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I blinked, confused. “Looking at you like what?” I tilted my head slightly, which only seemed to annoy her more.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“I said, stop it, pebble-face.” She shoved her hand against my face and pushed me back. I landed on my butt, a surprised grunt escaping me. When I got up, I caught a glimpse of her trying—and failing—to hide a smirk as she walked ahead.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Rinn stopped beside me, his long white hair catching the light as he looked down. “So smooth, young one. A truly masterful performance,” he said, his sarcasm almost tangible.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I brushed myself off and smiled. “What performance? I was just trying to thank her.” I glanced ahead at Gwen, now walking beside Beans and Bluma.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Rinn chuckled, a deep, amused sound. “Uh-huh. Let’s go. I don’t want us left behind out here.” </span><span class="c5">He gave me a soft pat on the back and walked ahead.</span><span class="c2"> The gentleness caught me off guard, but I couldn’t help smiling. Maybe he could change.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As we continued, the trees around us thinned, their branches brittle and leaves sparse. Their sickly forms groaned, the sound haunting and low, as though the mountains themselves were draining them of life. I wrapped my arms around myself, moving closer to Gwen. My shoulder accidentally bumped hers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Sorry,” I murmured, though my thoughts lingered on the unnatural state of the forest.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">She turned sharply, ready to snap at me, but paused when she noticed my unease. Instead, she looked toward the others. “Let’s just get through this place. I’ve got a bad feeling.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans nodded. “Good idea. I’ve had enough caves for one lifetime.” He chuckled briefly, though his expression quickly turned serious.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I scanned everyone’s faces. The same worry etched onto mine was mirrored in theirs. At the entrance to the cave, we all hesitated, none of us willing to take the first step.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Rinn broke the silence, sighing. “Come on, everyone. We’ll be fine.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans rolled his eyes. “No way. You’re in the back.” He marched ahead, Bluma following close behind with a nod.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Rinn shrugged but didn’t get far before Gwen shoved him against the cave wall.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Sorry about that,” I said, offering him a hand. He took it, brushing himself off.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Let’s get going, shall we?” he said dryly, his usual tone returning.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Inside, the air grew heavy, laden with the smell of damp earth. The walls hummed faintly, and an uneasy energy seemed to pulse through the tunnel. Shadows stretched unnaturally, and I couldn’t shake the feeling of unseen eyes watching us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Gwen’s movements, typically steady, were careful now. Her hand rested on her sword, her eyes darting to every shadow. Her unease mirrored mine, though neither of us spoke it aloud.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Behind us, Rinn’s footsteps were quieter than usual. His glowing green chain had dimmed, and something about him seemed… off. When I glanced back, he met my gaze with a brief nod, though it did little to reassure me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Don’t look too hard,” Gwen murmured, her voice barely audible. “Even he’s probably uncomfortable here.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">“Yeah, well… I’m not exactly a fan of tight spaces,” I admitted, trying to lighten the mood. </span><span class="c5">My words, though, felt hollow against the oppressive silence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ahead, Beans led the way, his posture unchanged as he moved through the darkness with ease. There was no light here—only the faint sense of shifting shapes that my eyes could barely make out in the murk. But Beans didn’t seem bothered, like he’d walked through tunnels like these a thousand times before. His usual confidence was tempered with something else now, a sharpness in his movements that suggested he wasn’t entirely sure what lay ahead.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bluma, ever the quiet one, kept close behind him. Her eyes scanned the walls, the ground, the shadows, her expression unreadable. She’d said little since we entered the tunnel, but I could feel the weight of her concern in the way she moved.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We walked in silence, the echoes of our footsteps growing louder, stretching out into the vastness of the cavern. The deeper we went, the darker it got. The walls began to narrow, forcing us to move single-file, and the air grew colder, heavier. I couldn’t tell if it was the mountain’s chill or something more unnatural creeping in, but the hairs on the back of my neck seemed to stand up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then we heard a soft scraping sound, like something dragging across stone. At first, I thought it was just my imagination, but then the others stopped, and I saw the tension in their faces.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"> “Did anyone else hear that?” Rinn’s voice was a low murmur, barely audible over the hum of the cave.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I swallowed hard, trying to focus, but the sound came again. Closer this time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Yeah,” Gwen said, her voice flat, but her hand was already on the hilt of her sword. “And I don’t like it.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The sound stopped, but the silence that followed felt even worse. It was thick, suffocating, pressing in on us from all sides.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“We need to keep moving,” Beans said, his voice sharp, though his eyes darted nervously around the tunnel. He didn’t wait for an answer, pushing forward with a grim determination.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As I followed, my steps echoing in the dark, I couldn’t shake the feeling that the walls were closing in on us, that the tunnel was alive and breathing. The humming had grown louder, almost deafening, and now it seemed to resonate in my chest.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen kept close to my side, her hand brushing mine as we moved, her usual sharpness replaced by a quiet vigilance. I could feel her tension, her readiness for whatever might be ahead, but I could see it in her eyes too—the same fear I had.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then, ahead, the tunnel opened up, and the walls widened into a cavern so vast it swallowed what little light we had. The ground was uneven, slick with moisture, and the air was thick with the scent of decay. I could hear the distant sound of dripping water, the only other noise in the oppressive silence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beans stopped in front of me, his face pale as he stared into the darkness. “This... this doesn’t look right,” he muttered, his usual bravado gone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Don’t panic,” I said, trying to sound braver than I felt. “We’ll get through this.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Deta…” Bluma said softly, and as I turned to see her approach me with caution, my eyes darted around, panicked that something was going to attack me, but I froze.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">“What…? Is it a snail?” I then saw Bluma pointing to my bag. Beans and the others then looked, and I saw their eyes wide</span><span class="c3">n.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Deta... what's in your bag?” Beans asked, and as I looked at it, I saw the amber glow coming from inside.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“It’s... the Soul Stone...” I muttered as I took it out of my bag. It was glowing brightly, illuminating the cavern we were in. As its light shone, we saw murals carved into the walls. I saw pictures depicting what looked like a kingdom underground, with a huge monster looming over it, and what looked like ice growing from its hands and onto the kingdom.<br/>        “How peculiar...” Rinn spoke in a soft voice, looking around. “These seem to be depictions of the Frost Era.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I then turned to Rinn. “I keep hearing about that. What was the Frost Era?” Everyone but Gwen turned to me almost at once.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Seriously, Deta? You've never heard of it?” Beans said in disbelief. “It’s like, a key moment in history!”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I gave a soft </span><span class="c3">titter </span><span class="c0">and shrugged. “Sorry?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen groaned loudly. “Who cares? I don’t know it, either.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beans turned to her. “Seriously?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I looked back at the picture of the monster. As I looked towards the bottom, I saw writing on the wall. “No way!” I smiled wide, recognizing the writing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rinn walked up to me and looked at the writing. “That’s some ancient language... I don’t think I’ve ever seen it before.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My smile continued as I turned to him. “It’s written in Randeth! A Randeth was here before. I wonder if it was this girl?” I then turned to the Soul Stone and lifted it a bit higher.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“I’m sorry, you can read this and... Girl? You can tell?” Rinn bent over slightly to take a closer look, his arms behind his back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I nodded. “Yes, girl, and yes, I can read this!” I gave the writing another look. “Looks like Vomete’s writing almost…” As I looked down to where the writing led, I saw another tunnel. “Seems I get a story and a way out. Over here, guys!” I called out to everyone, pointing towards the tunnel. Gwen and Beans were the first to head towards it, with Rinn following behind. I put the Soul Stone back into my bag and looked up to see Bluma still looking at the murals.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bluma looked at me, then pointed at the words, to which I nodded. “Yes, I can read that. Would you like me to?” She nodded, and I smiled as I turned to the wall and began to read aloud.</span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c3 c8 c6"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16 c8 c6 c17">Story of the Frost Era</span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c3 c8 c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c8 c6">In an age when frost choked the breath of the living and the sun was but a pale shadow, despair claimed the land. No gold could warm the hearth, no silver could fill an empty belly. A single drop of honey cost the wealth of kings, and yet, even kings were left to beg in the streets. The wilderness became a graveyard of the forsaken, their cries silenced by the endless snow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c8 c6">It began with the Ogre, a being whose heart was colder than the winds that carried his wrath. He sought to craft a world without flaw, where only the strong survived. To achieve this twisted perfection, he cast the lands into an unending winter, a realm of cruelty where mortals were but fleeting imperfections in his frozen playground.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c8 c6">Beneath the ice, a kingdom of stone and shadow rose. The Ice Dwarves, masters of the deep, offered refuge to those who could pay their price. But their king’s heart mirrored the Ogre’s malice. He bartered warmth and safety for loyalty, demanding more than flesh and blood could bear. Those who failed him were cast into the depths, their screams swallowed by the dark. When they returned, if they returned, they were changed—skin darkened, eyes hollow, hearts resigned to their prison of stone. Thus, the underworld became their kingdom, a realm of reluctant complacency.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c8 c6">Even the dragons were not spared. A mighty beast, once a symbol of freedom and fire, was bound in chains to warm the Dwarves’ halls. Its roars became the bitter song of servitude, its flames dwindled to embers, feeding the greed of its captors.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c8 c6">And yet, hope flickered like a lone candle in the storm. From the frost-bound land, a generation arose—the Coldborn. Their blood resisted the chill, their resolve unyielding. Trained by the cruel Dwarf king to be his hunters, they turned their weapons against him. Relics of forgotten power guided their hands as they ventured into the frozen wastes, seeking to end the Ogre’s reign.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c8 c6">Their first battle was a bitter failure. Against a being of godlike strength, they were but insects before a mountain. Wounded in body and spirit, they fled. Yet, when all seemed lost, a light pierced the heavens. From it descended a being of radiant power, whose words brought strength, wisdom, courage, and hope. Empowered by the divine, the Coldborn rose again, united in purpose.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c8 c6">The battle shook the earth and splintered the sky. Ice and fire clashed, and the Ogre’s laughter echoed until it was silenced. Did they slay the beast? Did they bind it to an abyss, its power sealed in the Tears of Winter? The truth is shrouded in time. But with the Ogre’s fall, the frost receded, and life returned to the land.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c8 c6">Yet not all wounds healed. The Ice Dwarves, architects of so much suffering, became the hunted. The wrath of those they betrayed followed them to the ends of the earth. Thus, the Frost Era ended, not with peace, but with blood and fire. Its scars remain, carved in stone and memory, for those who walk these halls to heed and remember-</span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c3 c8 c6"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16 c6 c17">Deta’s View</span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c3 c8 c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The writing ended, and the walls of the cave looked as though they had deteriorated. I walked next to Bluma in silence for a moment before she placed her hand on my shoulder.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Okay..." she said softly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I smiled and nodded. "Yeah... I'm fine." I glanced back one last time, watching the writing fade from view. </span><span class="c3 c8 c6">That really does look like Vomete’s handwriting... I hope this doesn’t take much longer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The ground began to shake beneath us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Earthquake!” Beans yelled as rocks started falling from the ceiling. “Everyone stick to the sides!”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We quickly pressed ourselves against the cave walls as cracks formed, and with a deafening rumble, the tunnel caved in ahead of and behind us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“We’re trapped!” Rinn called out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Oh, you don’t say!” Gwen added sarcastically.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When the shaking stopped, Beans rushed to one side of the tunnel, pushing futilely against the pile of rocks. "Come on... Move!" He let out a frustrated huff. "They're stuck tight."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Of course," Gwen growled. "Just great!" She leaned against the opposite wall. "Guess we'll just die in—"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The wall gave way beneath her, and she screamed as she tumbled down a hidden chute.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Gwen!" I yelled, running to the edge of the hole, her screams fading as she slid farther away.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A few seconds later, her voice echoed back up to us. “Get your butts down here! There’s another way!”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I sighed in relief and stood. Beans grinned. “Glad you’re okay!” he shouted down. “We’re coming!”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No sooner had he spoken than he pushed Rinn, sending him headfirst down the chute. Rinn’s startled yells were followed by a loud thud. Beans laughed so hard he doubled over, then jumped in after him. Bluma followed with a faint smile. I chuckled and took the plunge as well. Sliding down, I picked up speed as the twisting tube whipped me around. Faster and faster I went until I shot out of the end, slamming face-first into the stone wall.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen burst out laughing. "Alright, Bushy, nap time's over. Let's get moving."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Groaning, I stood and rubbed my head. Looking around, I realized this wasn’t just another part of the cave. Stone bricks lined the walls and floor.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“This doesn’t look like a normal cave,” I said, frowning.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beans nodded, his eyes scanning the walls. "It almost looks like an old tunnel from the Kingdom. There used to be a whole network of them connecting to it, but most were filled in and sealed off over the years. Wonder why this one was left open."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">His words hung in the air, making the silence of the ancient tunnel feel heavier.</span><hr/></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c2 c34"></span></p><h5 class="c7 c23" id="h.2xcytpi"><span class="c21">CHAPTER 19</span><span class="c8 c13">                                                                                                                Resolving Concerns: New and Old </span></h5><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">        We proceeded cautiously through the dark hall, our senses heightened and on edge. As I surveyed the surroundings, it became apparent that the walls, floor, and ceiling were made of solid stone, gradually transitioning into naturally shaped rocks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"I wonder where we are..." I whispered, my voice barely louder than the rustle of our clothes brushing against the walls.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"We're all wondering that. Just stay prepared," Beans replied. But before I could finish my sentence, a violent shaking and rumbling interrupted us, throwing us off balance. We stumbled and fell into one another.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Is everyone okay?" Beans called out, scrambling to his feet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"I'm fine!" I reassured him, and Rinn echoed the same.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Could it be an earthquake?" Gwen asked, brushing the dust from her clothes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beans nodded. "Seems like it..."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The ground trembled again, and this time we managed to brace ourselves against the wall to avoid falling. The intensity increased, making it harder to keep steady.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As I leaned against the wall for support, I noticed a crack forming. Before I could react, that section of the wall shattered, and I fell through.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Deta!" Beans shouted in concern as I disappeared. A sudden burst of orange light illuminated the corridor.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everyone rushed over to see what had happened, only to find that I had fallen just a few feet below. Chuckling, I greeted them, "Hi, guys."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beans let out a laugh of relief, while Bluma sighed audibly. Gwen quickly jumped down and hauled me up, but not without smacking me hard on the head, which sent me back to the ground.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Don't ever do that again!" she scolded.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I rubbed my head, looking up at her. "What was that for?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She didn’t answer and simply walked away.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bluma hopped down to help me to my feet. As Beans and Rinn joined us, Beans asked, "Are you alright, Deta?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"I'm fine," I replied, though I was still baffled by Gwen's forceful reaction.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rinn chuckled as he followed Gwen. "Well, apart from that, let's keep moving forward."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We pressed on down the corridor. The damp air caused water to drip from the ceiling, and the rising temperature made Bluma and Gwen’s hair puff up into frizz. Bluma took the lead, her sharp eyes scanning every detail of our surroundings.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The hallway branched into smaller rooms on either side. When we reached the farthest room, Beans peeked inside and suddenly shouted, "Hey, guys!" He emerged with a wide grin.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"I know where we are!" he exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen placed her hands on her hips and raised an eyebrow. "Oh, really? Where are we?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beans maintained his smile, but before he could answer, another earthquake shook the ground, accompanied by a deafening roar.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen, Bluma, and I exchanged startled glances.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Seriously?" I muttered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rinn raised an eyebrow. "What's gotten into all of you?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"No time to explain! Just keep up!" Gwen shouted, her voice urgent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We sprinted down the hallway, passing the branching rooms as fast as we could. As we descended deeper, the temperature grew more intense with every step. Eventually, we reached a vast cave entrance. Just as we were about to step inside, a blast of fire erupted from within.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Don't tell me that's the dragon!?" RInn exclaimed his expression laced with concern.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"You bet your violin it is!" Gwen shot back with a smirk.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bluma and Gwen drew their swords, their faces set with determination. Beans tightened his grip on his ax, and I held my staff, feeling its weight steady me. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rinn, ever skeptical, grumbled, "This is such a bad idea!" Yet even he pulled out his violin, ready to play.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As we stepped into the cavern, chaos greeted us: a colossal Guardian serpent locked in a ferocious struggle with a massive red dragon. The ground was strewn with corpses and the skeletal remains of enormous snakes, their bones gleaming white against the dark stone. It was impossible to count how many had perished. The cavern bore the scars of battle, with sunlight piercing through gaping cracks in the walls.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Without hesitation, we rushed forward to join the fray. The Serpent spotted us and boomed a warning, its voice shaking the air. "Get away, mortals! You do not belong in this fight!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen’s grin widened, her sword glowing with fiery energy. "Not a chance, scales!" She struck the ground with her blade, and a pillar of fire erupted, racing toward the dragon. The flames struck its chest but barely added to the wounds inflicted by the Serpent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With a roar, the dragon lashed out at the Serpent, sending it hurtling into one of the cavern’s yawning pits, its massive body vanishing into the depths of the Underworld.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The dragon’s deep laughter echoed through the space. "Foolish serpent... Now, for my next meal—then my escape!" It turned its massive head toward us, baring sharp teeth in a predatory grin. The wounds from its fight were severe: one leg was missing, and its single wing hung in tatters.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The dragon opened its mouth, and a bright yellow glow built within its throat. Flames surged toward us in a fiery torrent, but before they could reach, Rinn began to play his violin. The haunting melody redirected the flames, causing them to curl harmlessly around us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"What was that?" Gwen exclaimed, her shock matching our own.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rinn ended his song with a satisfied smile. "Told you. I’m better with my instrument."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The dragon growled, glaring at Rinn. "So, you brought a bard to this fight? How amusing." Its deep laughter rumbled as it lunged toward us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gwen and Bluma rushed to meet its charge, their swords blazing with energy. The dragon swiped at them with a claw, and though they blocked the attack, its strength sent them flying across the cavern.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The dragon spun with terrifying speed, its massive tail swinging through the air. Beans stepped forward and raised his arms to shield himself. Black dust seeped from his hands, disintegrating some of the dragon’s scales on impact. Even so, the blow sent him crashing into a jagged rock wall.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The dragon’s laughter rang out again. "This is the best you can do? Pitiful." It turned back to Gwen and Bluma, coiling its tail with deadly precision. "Time for dinner..."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Focused on them, it ignored Rinn and me, who had positioned ourselves beneath its towering frame.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"That staff better work now," I muttered, gripping it tightly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rinn nodded sharply and struck a high note on his violin. The sound rippled outward, slamming into the dragon’s leg and forcing it to stumble. We sprinted out from under it just as another jet of fire roared past, narrowly missing the others. The dragon crashed onto its side, its ruined wing crumpled beneath it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The beast roared in pain, thrashing as it tried to rise. Its bloodshot eyes swept the cavern until they locked onto us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"You... will pay for that," it snarled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Drawing in a deep breath, the dragon released three enormous fireballs. One hurtled toward us, another toward Gwen and Bluma, and the third toward Beans.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We saw no way of surviving and instinctively raised our arms, shielding our faces as we braced for the worst. The fiery onslaught hurtled toward us, and the heat of impending doom pressed heavy on my thoughts. Images of Vomete, Bluma, Beans, and even Gwen flickered through my mind. </span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c8 c6"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16 c8 c6 c17">Rinn’s View</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c8 c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The fire struck with a deafening roar, shaking the earth beneath us and sending shockwaves through the cavern. Just before the explosion hit I saw Deta put himself in front of me and before I could process it the explosion hurled us backward, scattering us like leaves in a storm. The dragon staggered, nearly toppling into one of the cavern’s massive chasms. Yet, with a menacing laugh, it regained its footing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When the smoke and debris finally cleared, the dragon peered at us with a smug expression, certain it had claimed victory. But its triumph quickly turned to confusion. Despite its devastating attack, we lay sprawled on the ground, covered in soot and ash, but after pushing the young creature's body off of me, I began to stand, my body scorched by burns so severe I could hardly move.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The dragon growled, its eyes gleaming with predatory hunger as it prepared to end us once and for all. But just as it lunged, a sharp strike pierced its remaining leg. The beast howled in pain, twisting to see the Guardian Serpent. Its emerald scales, flecked with black and crimson, glistened as it sank its fangs deep into the dragon’s flesh. The dragon roared and struck back, but the serpent coiled tighter, dragging its foe toward the edge of the chasm. With a final, violent pull, both titans tumbled into the abyss, their roars fading as they vanished into the Underworld.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As I heard their howls echo into the Underworld below. I wanted to fall onto my knees however distant voices broke the silence. Through cracks in the cavern walls, a people gathered, their murmurs rising in concern. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Someone must have recognized Bluma and Beans among the fallen and quickly called for the Knights.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Seems there is no rest for me…” I tried to limp away before the knights arrived. However, my imprisonment held my arms tightly forcing me to a complete stop. I turned to the young creature to see his own burns, one of his arms was even crumbling apart. “Young one, let me leave. I do not wish to be caught by the guards when they arrive.” </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Desperation clawed at me as I twisted around to look at him—the source of my imprisonment. His body was limp, his burns glowing faintly in the green light. One of his arms had begun to crumble, fragments of stone and wood falling away to reveal raw, pulsing moss beneath. The sight made bile rise in my throat, but I forced it down.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Dang it,” I growled, gripping the chains with both hands. “Wake up! I need you to let me go!”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The faint hum of the chains seemed to mock me. I yanked harder, my vision blurring with the effort and then—just as I feared—the unmistakable clamor of Knights being summoned.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“No, no, no!” I hissed, my movements becoming frantic. The chains glowed brighter as I fought them, their magic digging into my skin like fiery tendrils. I turned back to the creature, my breath heaving.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Young one,” I rasped, desperation dripping from my words. “I do not wish to be caught by the guards when they arrive. Let me leave!” My voice cracked, and I reached out to shake his shoulder, though I knew it was futile. His hollow, unconscious form gave no response.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">My eyes darted back to the glowing bonds. I could feel them in my mind, alive and pulsing, bound not to me, but to him. They wouldn’t let me leave—not until </span><span class="c3 c6">he</span><span class="c0"> allowed it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Please,” I whispered, the word tasting foreign on my tongue. “Wake up. Let me hide!”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, the chains flickered. For a moment, I thought I’d imagined it, but the steady glow wavered again, like the last moments of a candle’s flame. My breath caught as the green light faltered, the hum of magic growing softer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The chains shimmered, their edges breaking apart like wisps of smoke. Slowly, gently, the bonds faded into the air, leaving a faint, earthy scent behind. My arms fell limply to my sides, and I stared at the empty space where the chains had been.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was as though they’d never existed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I froze, disbelieving, before the distant clang of armor shattered my trance. Scrambling to my feet, I ran, ignoring the sharp protests of my battered body.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"> Healers arrived shortly after, tending to their injuries and carefully carrying them out of the cavern. Word of the battle spread quickly, reaching the King and even the farmers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the weeks that followed, they began to wake, one by one. Bluma and Beans were the first, recovering with surprising speed and resuming their duties. The King expressed his gratitude, relieved his daughter could grow up without the looming shadow of monsters. Beans’ parents wept with joy upon hearing of their son’s bravery.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"> Gwen regained consciousness a few days later, though she remained too weak to return to the field. I watched them all from the shadows, stealing food and water, but staying near the young creature.</span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c3 c8 c6"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16 c8 c6 c17">Deta’s View</span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c3 c8 c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When I finally opened my eyes, I found myself in a spacious room. The walls, made of finely cut stone, were adorned with green and gold silk curtains. I was on a bed, it was warm, and I was  wrapped in a blanket smoother than anything I had ever touched.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The door creaked open, and two men entered. One wore a golden laced cloak, his sharp eyes widening in surprise as he saw me awake. The other, clad in black, wore a peculiar beaked mask that obscured his face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"You’re awake! How is this possible?" the man in the cloak exclaimed, stepping closer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I smiled weakly, my voice barely above a whisper. "Hello... Who are you?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The man straightened and replied, "I am Council Member Baker" After whispering a few words to his masked companion, he turned back and left. "There’s much to explain. Do you feel well enough to talk?"</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0">I nodded, though unease began to stir within me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Baker hesitated, then began, "After the battle, you were believed to be dead. You were unconscious for over a month, and your… appearance led many to assume you were gone for good."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">His words were strange, but I listened as he continued.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"It was the Demon Knight who insisted we retrieve you. Many thought you were just rubble—stone debris from the cavern."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I let out a faint laugh, though the idea unsettled me. "I suppose I should be grateful for her persistence," I said, attempting to lighten the mood.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Baker didn’t smile. "During your coma, your condition began to change. Your outer layer—what seemed to be stone—started to crack and fall away. It wasn’t until recently that we realized…"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">His voice trailed off, but I didn’t need him to finish. I raised my arms, the blanket slipping from my shoulders. My breath caught in my throat. My left arm remained as it had always been, but my right hand… It was–Flesh.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I stared in disbelief, flexing the fingers of my right hand. The movement felt alien, as if it didn’t belong to me. I pinched the skin lightly, and pain shot through it—a confirmation of its reality.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"What… What’s happening to me?" I whispered, my voice trembling.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Baker placed a hand on my shoulder, his expression grave. "That’s what we need to find out." He then handed me a pair of gloves, which I slowly put on.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">His voice was calm, but there was a tremor in his grip—like he was bracing for something even he couldn’t predict.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">He instructed me to stand and perform basic functions. His eyes widened in surprise as I moved, his gaze lingering a moment too long, as if he couldn’t quite comprehend how I was managing after such an extended period of unconsciousness. But I couldn’t focus on his astonishment, not when my mind was preoccupied with a single pressing question: </span><span class="c3 c8 c6">What happened to my hand?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We walked toward the door, he muttering assessments, while I kept my focus solely on the mystery of my hand—why it felt wrong, cold, as if it didn’t belong to me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Suddenly, a loud clatter of armor sounded in the hallway, and a group of knights ran past, swords drawn, their faces grim and determined.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“What's going on?” I asked, stepping toward the door. My muscles burned from disuse, but I still felt the urge to move, to do something.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before Baker could answer, the ground trembled beneath us, followed by a thunderous explosion. My heart leapt into my throat, and he reacted instantly, pulling me back into the room, slamming the door shut, and locking it with swift, practiced movements.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He leaned against the door, his breathing shallow. "We must hide," he whispered urgently, his face pale. "We are under attack."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The words hung in the air, heavy and suffocating. I didn’t move. My instincts flared. </span><span class="c3 c8 c6">Hide?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">I glanced toward the door, a torrent of emotion flooding through me—confusion and frustration.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">“We should help,” I insisted, ignoring the cold dread that clung to his every movement.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He tried to speak, his voice trembling, but I was already moving, my body locked in the rhythm of urgency. I unlocked the door and swung it open, feeling the cool air rush past me, a stark contrast to the heat of my pulse.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ignoring Baker’s protests, I sprinted down the hall, my footsteps muffled by the chaos echoing from farther ahead.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I rushed through the castle, darting from room to room and hallway to hallway, uncertain of the right direction. The surroundings blurred together in my frantic search, making it difficult to navigate. Suddenly, another explosion resounded from above, prompting me to change course. I recalled seeing stairs earlier but remembered I had closed the door leading to them. Reaching the end of the hall, I opened a door, hoping it would lead to the stairs. Instead, I found myself in yet another dead end.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Frustrated but undeterred, I hesitated at the next door, drawn to the faint purple glow emanating from within. To my surprise, I found my staff lying in the middle of a weapon storage closet, alongside the rest of my belongings. Hastily, I collected them and resumed my search for the stairs. After several more minutes of searching, I finally located them and ascended, urgency driving every step.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At the top of the stairs, I emerged into a new hallway and immediately spotted a large, broken-down door. I bolted toward it, just in time to see Gwen being thrown out. Relief flooded me as I called out, "Gwen!" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She winced, clearly in pain, but her eyes widened in astonishment. "Bushy! You're alive?" she rasped. She attempted to stand but collapsed back down, her injury too severe.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Alarmed, I rushed to her side. "Gwen, don’t get up! Let me heal you. What in the world is happening?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her leg bore a deep wound, cutting down to the bone, and blood poured from it in a steady stream. It was a life-threatening injury. "The Queen went on a rampage," she gasped, wincing as her muscles twitched involuntarily. "Beans is chained to a wall, and Bluma... Bluma is under some kind of mind control."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fear gripped me at her words. "What?!" I exclaimed, the weight of the situation crashing down on me. In my panic, I accidentally pressed too hard on her leg, eliciting a sharp yell. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Ow, Bushy!" she cried, her voice filled with pain. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I pulled back immediately, apologizing profusely. Gwen let out a shaky sigh.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Yes... Bluma was ordered to kill me, but she didn’t," she continued. "She wounded my leg and threw me out here when we heard you. She’s still inside."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I pondered her words as I worked to heal her leg, my mind racing. What were we supposed to do? Bluma was immensely strong and dangerous in this state. "She’s still in there?" I asked, needing confirmation. Gwen nodded grimly, and I knew I had to make a decision.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Alright... then we have to try to bring her back," I said, standing and offering my hand to help Gwen to her feet. She swatted it away defiantly, her determination shining through her pain.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Run away? Hell no! I’m fighting with you!" she declared, fire in her eyes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I shook my head, panic rising in my chest. "No! If you fight, you’ll die! Now get out of here!" I pointed down the hall toward the stairs, my tone leaving no room for argument.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She stared at me for a moment in what looked like disbelief before growling and turning to leave.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I called out to her. "Thank you. And... I’m sorry."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She glanced back, her expression softening for a brief moment. "Don’t die, or I’ll bring you back just to kill you again," she warned before sprinting down the hall toward the stairs.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Well... that's one way to encourage someone, I guess," I muttered, smiling to myself. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Turning my attention back to the room I had entered, I took in the horrific scene. The walls were streaked with blood, and the severed bodies of knights lay scattered across the floor like discarded toys. Bluma was nowhere in sight, and dread clawed at me as I considered the magnitude of her destructive power. My thoughts spiraled toward the inevitable confrontation ahead, knowing the danger she now posed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lost in my apprehension, a voice behind me made me jump. "Still playing the hero, young creature?" Spinning around, I readied myself for a fight, only to feel a rush of relief when I saw Rinn.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Rinn!" I exclaimed, a smile breaking across my face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He chuckled softly, stepping closer. "Hello there, young one. It's been a while... I like your new hand," he remarked, his tone as casual as ever.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unable to resist teasing, I quipped, "I'd think you'd be itching to play the hero yourself, but I guess being my slave leaves you no choice." My grin widened at the irony.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Another tremor shook the castle, and the roof above us cracked ominously. Before it could collapse entirely, we both scrambled to safety. As the dust cleared, my heart sank at the sight before me. Bluma stood amidst the chaos, her eyes glowing an unnatural red, while the Queen loomed behind her, holding Beans in chains like a captured animal. His mouth was restrained by a steel muzzle, and his desperate attempts to communicate were muffled beyond understanding.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Queen yanked his chains upward, choking him as she hissed, "Silence." Her gaze fell upon us, and a sinister smile curled her lips. "So, the monster and their pet unite. Oh, how romantic," she taunted, her laugh ringing hollow and cold.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Something dark consumed her body, spreading from her left arm in jagged purple rocks that glowed faintly with magenta flames seeping through the cracks. The corruption climbed to her left eye and part of her face. In her corrupted hand, she clutched a dagger forged in the shape of a feather, its dark purple hue almost hypnotic.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"The Demon Knight," the Queen addressed Bluma, her voice dripping with mockery.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bluma raised her glowing white sword, and Rinn, never one to miss a beat, drew his violin. As I reached for my staff, Bluma lunged at me, her blade aimed to strike my neck. Panic flooded me; I knew I wouldn't react in time. Just as the sword descended, Rinn played a sharp, piercing E-flat, the sound reverberating like thunder. The force sent both Bluma and me flying. I managed to stay on my feet, but she tumbled before slowly rising, her movements stiff and mechanical.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Thanks, Rinn!" I called over to him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He groaned, clearly annoyed. "Shut up and pay attention!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bluma charged again, her strikes wild and unfocused. She swung at me, and I narrowly dodged, only for her to turn on Rinn. He sidestepped her attack with practiced ease, his expression sharp with concentration. Something about her erratic movements struck me—she wasn’t fighting like herself. Was she trying to miss us on purpose?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Back inside the castle, Rinn played a haunting B-flat that caused the roof to collapse on the Queen. Seizing the moment, he pulled me into a hiding spot and clamped his hand over my mouth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bluma burst from the rubble, her gaze scanning the room. The Queen snarled, "Don't just stand there! Go kill them!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bluma darted toward us, but instead of attacking, she sped past and disappeared down the hall.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rinn whispered, "I cast a spell to keep her busy. Now we have the Queen all to ourselves."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I nodded, and he released me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Queen turned to Beans, her voice a chilling promise. "You will be my next slave. Once I make you mine, the Demon won’t resist anymore." She reached for his face, but a rock thrown by Rinn struck her arm, sending her reeling. Her furious gaze locked onto him, and I stayed hidden, waiting for the right moment to act.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Why, you insignificant pleb!" she turned to him, readying her dagger, but </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rinn just smiled. "Pleb? How degrading, losing your mental lexicon so soon, falderal materfamilias? How disconsolate." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He laughed, which enraged the Queen and caused the magenta flames to roar. She formed a metal pole and stuck it into the ground, holding Beans' chains down, and charged at Rinn. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rinn chuckled, skillfully dodging her attacks and making his way towards the door. "I hadn't realized the Queen was so sluggish," he remarked, further fueling her anger. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Why you, fatuous trumpery!!" she yelled, chasing him out of the room.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Seeing this as an opportunity, I rushed over to Beans and tried to pull out the metal rod. Rinn's spell broke over me, and Beans could finally see me. He attempted to communicate something, but I couldn't understand. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Hold on! I almost got it!" I struggled to move the beam, but it was firmly stuck in the ground. Beans’ muffled protests came again as he pointed to my bag. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"What? Is there something in my bag?" I opened it and searched inside but found nothing of much use. "I don't know what you're asking for." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Frustrated, he groaned and knocked my bag out of my hands, causing its contents, including crystals from the Underworld, to spill out. Beans grabbed one of the crystals and used it to free himself from the chains and muzzle. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Taking a deep breath, he looked at me and said, "This is what I was asking for! Now we need to save Bluma!" He got up, shaking off the metal restraints. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"But how are we going to do that? She's gone crazy!" I asked, confused. Beans groaned and ran out of the door, beckoning me to follow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As we ran down the hall and stairs, Beans explained that a few days ago, the Queen and King had a heated argument. The Queen locked herself in her room, and when she emerged today, she was in her corrupted form and had taken control of Bluma. He mentioned that Bluma had been wearing a mask that she couldn't remove, so if we could break it, she might be freed. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"The crystals are incredibly strong and full of magic! We might be able to figure something out with them!" Beans exclaimed as we continued to run. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Suddenly, Bluma appeared from around the corner, her eyes still glowing red. Both Beans and I came to a halt, standing motionless in the hallway, unsure of each other's next moves.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bluma ran towards us, swinging her sword violently in an attempt to strike either Beans or me. I managed to dodge most of her attacks, but then her sword hit my staff and became lodged in the middle. I held the staff above me, trying to avoid getting hit. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Bluma, snap out of it!" I shouted. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Meanwhile, Beans approached from behind, but Bluma noticed him and kicked him, sending him to the ground. As Beans tried to recover, he turned around and saw Bluma preparing to strike him with her raised sword. He froze, unsure of what to do, his fear taking hold. However, before Bluma could hit him, I rushed forward and struck her with my staff, sending her flying back around fifty feet. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I helped Beans up, asking anxiously, "Are you okay?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beans shook his head, snapping out of his stupor, and nodded. "Yes, yes, I'm fine." </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I nodded in relief and turned my attention back to Bluma, who was starting to rise again. "We have a chance. She doesn't want to hurt us!" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beans remained silent but prepared himself for battle. Bluma charged towards us once more, swinging her sword. I tried to strike her with my staff, but she agilely evaded my attacks. Beans stayed close behind me, using my movements as an opportunity to dodge her strikes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She attempted to hit me in the face with her sword, but I managed to duck underneath it. Swinging my staff at her feet, she leaped over it, repositioning her grip on the sword's handle. As she descended, her sword was aimed to pierce through my back. In that critical moment, Beans jumped onto my back and struck the side of her blade, causing it to divert and miss me, embedding itself deeply into the ground. Instead of trying to retrieve it, Bluma punched me in the face, causing me to stumble backward. However, I regained my footing and lightly struck her arm, sending her into a spin and causing her to fall to the ground. Once I regained stability, I lifted my arm, summoning roots to emerge from the ground and ensnare her. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">"Beans, now!" I called out, signaling him to act.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beans rushed towards her, gripping the crystal tightly as he raised it above his head. As his hand made contact with her mask, a cascade of black dust began to fall, enveloping them both. In that moment, an eerie silence filled the air, and Bluma found herself frozen in place while Beans carefully disentangled himself from her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Simultaneously, the roots that had ensnared Bluma began to retract, retreating back into the earth. Gradually, she regained her footing, her eyes still emanating a haunting red glow. Beans examined the crystal in his palm, only to discover that its once brilliant surface had transformed into a lifeless black hue, crumbling into a fine dust. He shifted his gaze back to Bluma, and an intense stare-off ensued between the two of them, as if a profound understanding had passed between them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Suddenly, cracks emerged on Bluma's mask, starting small but multiplying rapidly. They spiderwebbed across its surface, extending from the lower jaw up to her hairline. The glowing red in her eyes dissipated, leaving behind an abyssal darkness. Finally, the mask shattered completely, clattering onto the ground below, revealing Bluma's unmasked countenance.</span></p><hr/><h5 class="c11 c9" id="h.agp4c7w5hwgz"><span class="c5 c8 c45 c22"></span></h5><h5 class="c7 c23" id="h.1ci93xb"><span class="c21">CHAPTER 20</span><span class="c13 c8">                                                                                                                    Tyrant Size Rampage</span></h5><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c5 c8 c6 c14"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16 c6">Rinn’s View</span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I managed to slip away from the Queen for a few precious seconds, drawing a deep breath as I darted into the main hall. It was the same grand room where a lavish party had been held just a month before. Now, it stood empty, its opulence veiled in shadow. I pressed myself behind a pillar, straining to quiet my breath, but her voice pierced the stillness.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Where are you?" Her cold tone echoed, accompanied by the sharp, deliberate rhythm of her heels against the floor. "I know you're in here... I can sense it."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">A low, mocking chuckle followed, and with it, the oppressive heat of her magenta flames. The air thickened, and sweat pricked at my brow as my mind scrambled for a plan. Her footsteps grew louder, and the crushing weight of doom clawed at my chest—a feeling as dark and relentless as the void.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">And yet, that very darkness thrilled me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">This was my life. Always evading the law, dancing on the razor's edge between sanity and madness. Grooming death with my gaze before slipping out of its grasp—this was what I did best. No, this was what I </span><span class="c5 c6">lived</span><span class="c5"> for. It earned me the title </span><span class="c5 c6">The Master Rogue, Prince of Shadows: Rinn.</span><span class="c2"> To me, her pursuit was nothing more than another game. A challenge.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The Queen’s steps slowed, then stopped. She was close now. I could feel her presence even before her voice dropped into a taunting whisper.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"I found you..."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Her dagger sliced through the air, the blade scraping against the stone where I had been. A flicker of triumph crossed her face as she stepped around the pillar—only to find empty space. Her smirk faltered. As her hand brushed the damaged pillar, realization dawned too late.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">From the shadows, a massive stone golem surged forward, snatching her in an unyielding grip. She struggled, the cursed flame in her eyes burning hotter, until a burst of searing fire forced the creature to release her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">She landed gracefully, but fury twisted her features. Raising her accursed arm, she smashed the golem with a brutal punch, its form crumbling into a heap of shattered stone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">And then she saw me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I stepped into a beam of pale light spilling from the high windows, the glow illuminating the smirk tugging at my lips. Her flames burned brighter, the creeping curse consuming more of her face as she prepared to strike.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">But I was ready.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">With deliberate poise, I raised my violin, its strings glinting with an ethereal light. A haunting melody filled the air as music stirred from nowhere and everywhere all at once. I inclined my head in a mock bow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Queens and tyrants!" I declared, my voice carrying through the hall. "It is with the greatest pride that we gather here tonight. So, relax. Put away your flames. For the Prince of Shadows is proud to present…"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I drew the bow across the strings, the music swelling to a crescendo.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Our demise."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">A grin spread across my face as I drew the bow across the strings, filling the hall with an upbeat and welcoming tune. The Queen charged at me in a blur of fury, but the Stone Golem reformed, grabbing her leg mid-stride and hurling her back toward the pillar. With an acrobatic twist, she landed against the pillar and launched herself across the room.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Her legs had transformed into a swirling vortex of black stone and crimson energy, keeping her suspended in the air. Her hair ignited into deep purple flames, blazing brighter with every second. Hurtling toward me, she snarled, “Enough of that </span><span class="c5 c6">insufferable noise!</span><span class="c2">”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">A fiery orb formed in her hand, seething with destructive energy, but she veered mid-flight as a massive boulder sailed toward her—a gift from the golem. It followed her motion with unrelenting precision, hurling rock after rock to the rhythm of my song. The Queen countered with a flurry of fireballs, each collision sending shards of stone scattering across the hall. She grinned, drawing an enormous fireball from thin air and hurtling it at the golem, obliterating it into a heap of shattered stone once more.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Nice try, Rinn,” she taunted, her lips curling into a smirk, “but your little distractions have failed.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">She rushed toward me, a streak of fire and fury. Instead of fleeing, I played faster, the violin’s strings glowing with an ethereal light. The notes swirled into a crackling bolt of lightning that lashed out at her, striking her mid-charge and pushing her back a few feet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I chuckled, tilting my head. “Oh, we’re just getting started, Your Majesty. This? This is only the warm-up.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Her growl echoed like thunder as she flung her dagger toward my violin, aiming to sever its strings. I sidestepped and retaliated, striking a sharp chord that sent another bolt of lightning searing toward her. The Queen raised her hand, summoning a roaring stream of fire to meet the lightning. The forces collided with a violent crackle, neither relenting.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Electricity arced wildly from my violin, striking the floor and nearby pillars with resounding booms that rattled the hall. Sweat trickled down my back as the thrill of the battle fueled me. I played louder, pouring every ounce of energy into the music, and the lightning surged with newfound ferocity. Smaller bolts branched out, dancing across the air, their chaotic light illuminating the Queen’s feral expression.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">But she was undeterred.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Raising her other hand, her flames erupted into a swirling inferno. The fire consumed my lightning with startling speed, forcing me to leap aside as the chromatic purple blaze hurtled toward me. I narrowly evaded it, landing in a roll as her laughter rang out behind me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Don’t think you can run from me!” she mocked, her voice dripping with menace.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Drawing a quick breath, I set my violin to my chin and struck a series of rapid chords. The stone around the fireplace sprang to life, snaking toward her and coiling tightly around her frame. With a deafening crack, the tendrils of stone dragged her into the roaring fire. Her blood-curdling screams echoed through the hall as the flames scorched her skin.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I took my chance. Smirking, I bowed deeply. “See you next fall,” I quipped, before slamming the heavy doors shut. Snatching a sword from a nearby knight statue, I wedged it tightly between the handles.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Spinning on my heels, I bolted down the corridor, heading for a staircase spiraling upward. “That should buy me some time,” I muttered to myself, a dark chuckle escaping my lips. “Can’t let her loose, or I’ll regret it.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Behind me, the Queen’s screams shifted, her voice distorting into a guttural roar that reverberated through the castle. A crash shattered the stillness, and I glanced back to see the doors explode outward in a shower of splinters.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">There she stood, her form unrecognizable. Her hair blazed in wild, golden-red flames, and her body dripped with molten violet lava. Her eyes were voids of seething fury.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">“Insolent, </span><span class="c5 c6">pathetic</span><span class="c2"> wretch,” she snarled, her voice a monstrous screech that shook the very earth. “I will kill you today, if it’s the last thing I do!”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Her roar split the air, shaking the walls as she tore through the hallway in pursuit, destruction trailing her every step.</span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c5 c8 c6 c14"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16 c8 c6 c14">About a Month Before</span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c5 c8 c6 c14"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">The Queen paced her chambers, muttering under her breath. “Wasting time and energy on some... creature! What good will it do when it finally dies? None! Resources squandered, resources that should go to </span><span class="c5 c6">my people</span><span class="c2">…”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">She stopped by the window, gazing out at the kingdom below. Her subjects bustled about their lives, unaware of her frustrations. Bluma and Beans patrolled along the streets, their presence reassuring to the common folk but grating to her in that moment. She scoffed and turned away, a sneer curling her lips. </span><span class="c5 c8 c6 c14">My people deserve better than wasted effort and hollow sentiments…</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Crossing to her bedside, she opened the drawer of her nightstand and drew out an ornate bracelet gifted by the Council of Seven. Its gem shimmered faintly with a menacing glow. She slipped it onto her wrist. The moment she did, a voice rang out, cold and commanding, echoing in her mind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Why not show him what you mean?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The Queen remained composed, though her knuckles tightened. “And what do you mean by that?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The voice chuckled darkly, its tone brimming with malice. “Prove your point. Show him your power. Demonstrate that your word is law—unyielding, absolute. Show him... the power of Hellfire.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The gem flared to life, bathing the room in a crimson light. Flames erupted around her in a violent blaze, and when they subsided, the Queen found herself transported.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The ground beneath her feet was scorched and cracked, glowing with searing red veins of molten lava. The heat was suffocating, the air heavy with ash. She took a slow breath and turned toward the source of a guttural growl.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">A colossal being loomed before her, towering over twenty-eight feet tall. Its massive frame was forged of dark red brimstone, with glowing cracks that spilled flames and liquid magma onto the ground. A single enormous eye, vivid red with a black slit for a pupil, stared down at her. Despite its humanoid form, it lacked a head, the eye embedded directly into its massive torso. It crouched to scrutinize her, radiating unbearable heat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The Queen met its gaze, unflinching. “What is it you want of me?” she demanded, her voice resolute.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The creature’s growl deepened, reverberating like thunder.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">“I seek the power to </span><span class="c5 c6">end</span><span class="c5"> the defiance of my husband and to rid my kingdom of that repulsive Randeth, </span><span class="c5 c6">Deta.</span><span class="c2">” Her voice carried every ounce of her authority and bitterness.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The creature stilled, then erupted into a booming laughter that shook the infernal plain. “Deta, you say? Intriguing. Very well, mortal. I shall grant you power beyond imagination. But there is a price: become my advocate. Take Deta’s soul stone, and when you deliver it to me, your power shall grow boundless.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Its massive hand reached for her. The Queen stood firm as blistering heat from the creature’s finger scorched the air. Her hair whipped about her face as the searing digit neared. When it touched her forehead, white-hot pain ripped through her. She doubled over, clutching her head, as a mark burned into her skin—three rhombuses: one sideways with two nested within, all bisected by a single line.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The pain was excruciating, yet exhilarating. Dark purple brimstone erupted from her skin, covering her face and hands. Flames licked from the cracks, and her anguished cries turned to wild, ecstatic laughter. The rush of strength and newfound power overwhelmed her senses. She straightened, marveling at her transformed body.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“So this… this is what true power feels like,” she murmured, her lips curving into a sinister smile. “It’s magnificent.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The creature chuckled and rose to its full height, its eye gleaming. “This power will awaken fully when Deta is near—or if he does not exist to challenge you by then.” Its voice dripped with menace as it continued, “As my advocate, you are granted another gift: the ability to corrupt those you choose. Draw my mark upon their flesh, and in time, they shall bend to your every will. Now go.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The Queen blinked, and in an instant, she was back in her chambers. The bracelet's gem pulsed faintly on her wrist, a lingering reminder of the pact she had just forged.</span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c5 c8 c6 c14"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16 c8 c6 c14">Present</span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As our fight continued I had taken notice of her movements becoming erratic and random, contrasting her previous strategic approach. While sudden changes in battle tactics might catch others off guard, I managed to evade her fiery attacks and lead her through the castle's halls. By making last-second turns, I caused her to miss me and allowed myself to gain more ground. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I turned to her and chuckled, teasing, "What's wrong? Am I going too fast?" </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">She yelled at me in frustration, calling me "Viel mutt," and increased her speed. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Anticipating an upcoming hall, I turned the corner earlier than expected, allowing the Queen to easily see which way I went. However, when she turned the corner, I had vanished. She searched the area briefly before yelling profanities and charging off to find me. I sighed in relief.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">In the weeks leading up to this encounter, I had explored the kingdom and discovered many escape routes and hiding places. This particular hall was filled with hiding spots and had numerous offshoots. It was lined with suits of armor, behind one of which I found a small hole in the wall. It was just big enough for me to squeeze into, leading to a small tunnel that would take me to the dining hall. As I emerged from the tunnel and stood in the dining hall, I quickly assessed the surroundings, searching for anything useful. </span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Time is running short... Let's see what I can find," I muttered, determined.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">It didn't take long for the Queen to arrive in the dining hall. Seeing me standing there in front of the fireplace, she exclaimed, "Die, swine!" She hurled a fireball at me, but I swiftly dodged it. The fireball exploded upon hitting the wall behind me, propelling me towards her unexpectedly. She grinned, grabbing me by the neck. "Looks like your little game of hide and seek is over," she taunted, her burning grip growing hotter.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Chuckling, I responded, "You keep saying that... but you keep being wrong!" I pulled out my dagger and stabbed it into her eye, causing her to release me and allowing me to escape her grasp. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As soon as I hit the ground, I swiftly moved behind her. The Queen, dismissing the pain, quickly turned around, but I seized the opportunity and kicked her hard, causing her to stumble and fall back into the now-lit fireplace. The flames burned her, intensifying her agony</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As I rushed into the dungeon with the cursed Queen hot on my heels, I looked around for any means of escape or something that could help me. The dungeon was dimly lit, with damp stone walls and a musty smell that filled the air. The sound of the Queen's enraged screams echoed through the corridors, adding to the sense of urgency.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Spotting a row of prison cells along one side, I quickly decided to seek refuge inside one of them. I hurriedly unlocked a nearby cell door and stepped inside, shutting it behind me just as the cursed Queen reached the entrance of the dungeon. Peering through the iron bars, I watched as she scanned the area, her fiery eyes filled with anger and a thirst for vengeance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I froze at the roar, glancing back. “…Well, that’s less than ideal.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I sprinted up the narrow staircase, my heart pounding with every step. If she caught me here, there’d be no escape. Thankfully, a door loomed near the top—a chance to outmaneuver her and finally trap this tyrant for good. The stairs seemed endless, but I reached the door at last. A laugh escaped me, but the sound of splintering wood cut it short.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Looking back, I saw her standing in the wreckage of the shattered doorway, her blazing eyes locking onto mine. My breath hitched as I stumbled through the door, slamming it shut behind me. Her enraged scream rattled the air, and I didn’t dare look back as the sound of her claws scrabbling up the stairs grew louder.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I found myself in a charred room, scorch marks covering every surface. It looked like an abandoned lab—maybe the sorcerer’s? Rumor had it he’d vanished long ago. Desperately scanning the area, I spotted a large, rusted shield behind an overturned bookshelf. It was decorative at best but sturdy enough for one hard hit. Everything else was just burned books and paper.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Rats.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Another door stood on the far side of the room, leading to a dark, narrow staircase. It reeked of mildew and seemed like a poor escape route. Before I could decide, the door I’d just come through exploded inward, the Queen crashing through like a raging beast. Without thinking, I grabbed the shield, jammed it beneath me, and leapt onto the stairs, riding the shield like a sled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The improvised escape was faster than I anticipated—too fast. Every bump sent me airborne, and panic rose as I sped uncontrollably toward the bottom. The sharp edge of the stairs disappeared into a solid wall ahead. With no other option, I rolled off the shield as it hit the floor. I tumbled painfully across the stone, the shield slamming into the wall with a deafening crack before snapping in two.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Groaning, I sat up and checked for injuries. Thankfully, I seemed fine—until I noticed my violin in splinters beside me. “…Perfect.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I looked around. Two doors stood before me. One bore a faded, crooked sign that read “Dungeon,” while light glowed faintly under the other. No time to think. I chose the lit door, stumbling inside to find a man with blonde hair and a filthy black apron. Strange machines and contraptions cluttered the room.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Hey! You need to get out of here!” I shouted, slamming the door behind me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The man turned, startled. “Why?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">“Because the Queen’s a monster now, and she’s coming </span><span class="c5 c6">this way!</span><span class="c2">”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">His eyes widened in excitement, not fear. “You brought a monster here? </span><span class="c5 c6">Perfect!</span><span class="c2">”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I stared, dumbfounded. “What is wrong with you?”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">He ignored me, rummaging through the clutter before pulling out a bizarre crossbow fitted with an equally strange bolt. “This is just the test subject I need!”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I had no time for his nonsense. Before he could explain, the Queen shattered the door behind me. Without hesitation, I grabbed the crossbow and fired.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The bolt hit its mark. The Queen screamed, her form warping and stretching as the curse twisted away from her body. She collapsed to the ground, separated from the magic. The curse itself took shape, writhing and unstable.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">I turned on the man. “What </span><span class="c5 c6">was</span><span class="c2"> that?!”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">He only grinned. “It works!”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">The Queen had shrunk, encased in a small glowing orb, now motionless. Before the curse could rise, I grabbed the orb, stuffing it into my satchel. “We’re not done here,” I growled, shoving him toward the exit. “Now </span><span class="c5 c6">run!</span><span class="c2">”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The curse screeched, its twisted form lunging as I kicked it back one last time. With no other choice, I threw myself through the dungeon door and bolted into the suffocating darkness.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Its inhuman wails echoed through the narrow halls, the sound chasing me, relentless and deafening. I ran blindly, the air growing colder with every step.</span></p><hr/><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><h5 class="c7 c23" id="h.3whwml4"><span class="c21">CHAPTER 21</span><span class="c32">                                                                                                                     Gwen's Fight        </span><span class="c8 c45 c22 c50">                    </span></h5><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c5 c8 c6 c14"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16 c8 c6 c14">Gwen’s View</span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c5 c8 c6 c14"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The outside world was wrecked. Flames chewed through houses, and those freaky golems—same eerie junk as the Queen—were tearing through the streets. One of them was chasing three kids. The oldest, maybe ten, threw his arms out in front of the others like he could actually block a fireball. His face was a mess of dirt and tears.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Go away! Don’t hurt us!” he shouted, voice cracking badly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The golem didn’t even blink. It raised its arm, ready to torch them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Too late.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Flames shot up from the ground and swallowed it whole. I sprinted in, sword flaring red.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“What the hell! You three okay?!”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">The oldest looked up—and froze. Then he ran straight into me, hugging like his life depended on it. That’s when I recognized him. Aaron. We’d crossed paths before, back when things weren’t </span><span class="c5 c6">this</span><span class="c2"> on fire.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Their mom came tearing around the corner, scooped them up, and bolted, shouting a breathless thank-you over her shoulder.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">And just as they disappeared, the ground shook. Out came another golem—twelve feet tall and twice as pissed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I smirked, sword humming in my grip.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Alright then. Just you and me, ugly.”</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I spun on my heel and slammed my blade into its face, hard enough to crack stone. The thing screamed—if you could call that sound a scream—and I didn’t give it a second to recover. Drove my sword straight into its shoulder, deep enough to feel the heat pulsing through the thing. Using the hilt like a foothold, I vaulted over its head, twisting in the air.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Mid-leap, I tore the blade free and brought it crashing down into its back, forcing the monster to its knees with a satisfying crunch.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">“Now </span><span class="c5 c6">that’s</span><span class="c2"> more like it,” I muttered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c6">Finally.</span><span class="c2"> I didn’t waste the opportunity. One swift strike severed its leg, eliciting an ear-splitting roar.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c6">Do these things ever shut up?</span><span class="c2"> I thought, brushing damp strands of hair out of my face. My gaze shifted to a small group of townspeople huddled nearby—those who had foolishly strayed from the main group meant to protect them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Didn't I tell you to stay together?" I snapped. But before they could answer, the groaning creak of collapsing wood drew my attention. I turned to see one of the guard towers falling, consumed by flames.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Mother of hell," I growled under my breath, rushing toward the stragglers. "Move, now!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As we ran, a child's cry cut through the chaos. I looked back to see a young boy sprawled on the ground, calling for his mother. The woman tried to run to him, but I stepped in her way.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"I’ve got him! You keep going!" I shouted and sprinted toward the child as the flaming tower crumbled, threatening to crush us both.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c6">You’ve got to be kidding me,</span><span class="c2"> I muttered through gritted teeth, raising my glowing sword. The gem near its tip blazed with white light. With a powerful swing, a blade of fire erupted from the sword and sliced through the collapsing tower, halving it just before it could reach us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I scooped the boy into my arms and climbed over the smoldering debris to rejoin the others. His mother rushed toward us, tears streaming as she clutched her child tightly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Alright, enough with the waterworks! We need to regroup!" I barked, gripping my sword. The mother nodded, now holding the boy firmly as we continued toward the knights' barracks, where the rest of the townsfolk had taken refuge.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">We dashed through the burning streets, our goal painfully far. Suddenly, distant footsteps echoed closer. I motioned for the group to follow me and ducked into a narrow alley. Peering around the corner, I saw more brimstone creatures smashing their way into homes, their lumbering forms searching for survivors. Finding none, they pressed on—straight toward our hiding spot.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I held a finger to my lips, signaling silence. For a moment, everything seemed still. Then, a child sneezed.   shhhh</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">My breath hitched. One of the monsters stopped and turned toward the alley, sniffing the air.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">The creature’s bulk filled the entrance as it loomed over us. I pressed myself against the wall, clutching my sword tighter. The mother behind me wrapped her children in trembling arms. </span><span class="c5 c6">I can't take this thing down alone,</span><span class="c5"> I thought, </span><span class="c5 c8 c6 c14">but I’ll be damned if I let it get to them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The monster hesitated, scanning the shadows. Then, as abruptly as it had appeared, it moved on, its thunderous footsteps fading into the distance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">A wave of relief swept over me. I motioned for the group to follow, and we slipped out of the alley, hurrying toward the barracks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As we ran, my mind drifted to the day before when everything seemed normal. Children laughing in the streets, guards on their routine patrols, and mothers chatting while keeping watch. It felt like a dream now, overshadowed by memories of an encounter a month prior—the dragon. Unlike anything I'd fought before.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c5">        I’d survived, but barely. Deta hadn’t been so lucky. The sight of his withered, leafless form still haunted me. </span><span class="c5 c6">You’d better wake up, Bushy. I still owe you.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5 c8 c6 c14"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16 c8 c6 c14">Yesterday</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c5 c8 c6 c14"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">I slipped my hand into my pocket, feeling the smooth edges of the soul stone that was vital to him. </span><span class="c5 c8 c6 c14">Not a chance I’m letting those healers get their hands on this for ‘experiments.’</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The stone disappeared back into my pocket just as a familiar voice called out:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Hey, Gwen!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I turned, near unwillingly, to see Beans and Bluma approaching. Beans waved enthusiastically, a toxic grin plastered on his face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"What do you want, short stack?" I smirked, noticing his visible annoyance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Very funny. Ha ha," he groaned, which made me chuckle. Bluma patted his head, helping ease his tension.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"So, what's up?" I asked, folding my arms.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans asked if I'd be willing to accompany them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"What for? I'm a little busy," I replied.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans inquired, "With what?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Nonyor," I retorted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Confusion flashed between Beans and Bluma as they glanced at each other.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Nonyor?" Beans asked, incredulously.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"None. Your. Business," I chuckled. "I'm kidding. I'm bored out of my mind here. Let's go."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans groaned and chuckled, and I could tell Bluma found it amusing as well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">"Alright! Let's go!" Beans said, attempting to shrug off my </span><span class="c5 c6">amazing</span><span class="c2"> pun.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">We walked across town toward a door on the side of the main castle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"What's this place?" I asked, curious.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans smiled as he opened the door. "This is the knights' barracks!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As the door swung open, I saw a few well-built men either donning or removing their armor. They chatted in various accents, but fell silent when they made eye contact with Bluma. I chuckled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"So, you wanted to show me a smelly room of half-naked men?" I teased.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans shook his head. "It's on the other side. Follow us!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans took the lead, and I followed. My sword was sheathed, so I couldn't understand why they were all staring at me instead of Bluma or Beans.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Just as Beans opened another door, a very tall, white-haired man with wisps of hair clinging stubbornly to his shiny scalp stepped into my path. Beans and Bluma froze, and I followed suit. The man’s thin, cracked lips stretched into a wide, unnerving grin that didn’t reach his watery eyes, which darted blatantly down to my chest.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">“Well, aren’t you a sight for sore eyes,” he drawled, lingering far too long with his gaze.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I didn’t give him time to finish whatever vile thought was brewing. A quick roundhouse kick to the head sent him crumpling to the ground, clearing my path in one satisfying motion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"You’re in my way."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">The other men started reaching for their swords, but Bluma raised her hand, signaling them to stand down. I smiled to myself, thinking, </span><span class="c5 c6">Now I have more people to fight later.</span><span class="c2"> I enjoyed the thrill of combat, but that would have to wait. I followed Beans through the doorway and into a tunnel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Where are we going?" I asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans smiled. "The arena!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Surprised and filled with excitement, I exclaimed, "The arena! Oh, this will be fun."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans smiled, and as we arrived at the door, it revealed a large, empty, flat area with incredibly large stands. I walked into the center, smiling as I looked around.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Nice, it gives you all the room to mess around," I remarked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Bluma chuckled. "Spar?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I immediately turned around and replied, "Oh, heck yes."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">She drew her sword, and so did I. Beans chuckled and moved to the side. Last time, when Deta and I fought Bluma, his lack of skill had made it easy for her to keep an eye on me while I had to look after him. But this time, Bushy </span><span class="c5 c6">isn't</span><span class="c2"> here, so I don’t have to babysit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As I unsheathed my sword, it grew to its large size, and I smiled, assuming my stance. Bluma also drew her black sword, and we charged at each other.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Bluma approached me in an unusual line, so when we were within striking range, I jumped to the side, just out of her reach. To my surprise, she did the same. Seizing the opportunity, I jumped forward and swung my sword in a wide yet swift arc. However, she easily dodged it by leaping into the air, then attempted to swipe at my shoulder. Anticipating her move, I tried to dodge, but she managed to leave a scratch on my cheek.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">In response, my sword glowed bright red as I swiped it again, sending fire blasting toward her. She darted back and forth, evading the flames, then used her sword to parry one of the fire blasts. She swiftly lunged forward, and our swords clashed, continuing the exchange of blows. At one point, I managed to dodge one of her swings, leaving a cut on her arm.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Our fight persisted late into the night until, as she ran toward me, she suddenly tripped and twitched in pain. Confusion washed over me, as I hadn't struck her in a way that would cause her to fall.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans rushed over to Bluma. "Bluma! Bluma, what's wrong?" He helped her up. She quickly straightened herself and held her head. I noticed her eyes flickering red.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">She patted Beans' head then briskly walked away, sheathing her sword. I watched her depart, unable to shake off my bewilderment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Turning to Beans, who seemed worried, I inquired, "What happened with Bluma?" I was still puzzled by her glowing red eyes and what made her collapse.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Beans replied, "It’s fine, but the arena serves another purpose." He began talking about the arena's true function, but I could easily tell he wanted to mention something about what had just occurred. He knew something—</span><span class="c5 c8 c6 c14">but what was it?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I decided not to pry into Beans' life. It wasn’t my place to do so; that’s Bushy’s job.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans explained that the arena served as a refuge during emergencies. If something happened in the kingdom, everyone could gather there to lay low or escape through the catacombs if necessary.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"A maze?" I raised an eyebrow. "That’s a pain, but I see what you mean."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans nodded in agreement. "Yes, but it’s getting late. We should probably turn in. I’ll see you when I see you!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">He smiled and ran off. I remained in the arena, gazing up at the starry night sky. I let out a sigh, remembering my first night in this kingdom.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Bushy... you better not be dead," I muttered, then turned away and headed back to the inn.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Upon reaching the room where our crazy journey began, I took in the sight. The room contained four beds and a few windows on the wall. I sighed and approached the bed closest to the window where Deta would typically lie, sitting down and gazing out. From the window, I could see a pillar of the castle and the plains beyond the castle walls, stretching toward the east.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">A snail was slowly making its way along the open window ledge, attempting to enter. Irritated, I grabbed the tiny creature and tossed it out the window. "Get out!" I muttered under my breath. I watched it fly into the sky and disappear from view. As I turned around, something caught my eye—a window in the castle pillar within view had emitted a brief, bright red glow before vanishing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c6">Something isn’t right here,</span><span class="c2"> I thought.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">I closed the window and sighed, trying to push aside the growing sense of danger. </span><span class="c5 c6">I must just be tired. Some sleep might help.</span><span class="c2"> Walking over to the door, I locked it by placing a dresser in front of it, then lay down on the bed next to the closed window, attempting to drift off to sleep. But sleep eluded me. The air carried a sense of impending danger I couldn't shake off.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">In the early hours of the morning, I left my room and wandered through the town.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As I walked, the familiar surroundings led me to the decision to visit the old man. The town was remarkably peaceful, though an unsettling feeling lingered within me. The amber-colored sky gradually rose, the moon receding over the horizon, and the kingdom began to be illuminated by the first light of day. With the sun rising and casting light on my path, I arrived at the site of the old man's house—only to find it burned to the ground.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">"What the heck!" I ran toward the charred remains, sifting through the rubble. The books I had opened were now reduced to ashes. As I surveyed the scene, I realized the old metal door was gone, along with most of their belongings, either destroyed by the fire or stolen. Anger welled up within me. </span><span class="c5 c6">Who would do such a thing?</span><span class="c2"> The old man and his wife hadn't done anything wrong!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Attempting to comprehend what had transpired, I spotted a knight walking through the streets, heading in my direction. Determined, I approached him and demanded an explanation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"You! What happened here?!" I yelled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The knight looked at me in confusion and asked what I meant.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"You very well know what I mean! What happened to this house? Who burned it down?!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The knight raised an eyebrow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Ma'am, calm down. This isn't recent, you know... This house burned down a thousand years ago. It's a town monument from the Frost Era."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c6">What the hell!? What is he saying!?</span><span class="c5"> </span><span class="c5 c6">I was just here a month ago!</span><span class="c2"> I thought, growing increasingly perplexed and angry at his apparent deceit. Sensing my disbelief, the knight spoke again, trying to prove his point.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Look, read the stone inscription on it." He pointed toward a large stone with a metal plate attached to it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I marched over to examine it, and what I read left me astonished:</span></p><hr/><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c9 c12"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><hr/><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">This is the home of the craftsmen family,</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Beloved by those in the kingdom </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Susie otherwise known as Nana would</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Care for any who found themselves in need.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">While her husband Harold was a Master Smith.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">The only one to have been able to forge blades from the horn of a </span><span class="c5">skrelp</span><span class="c2">.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">We honor this land to remember their kindness and also the harshness of the Frost Era in which they survived.</span><hr/><hr/></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I stood there in disbelief as the knight spoke, insisting that the house had burned down a thousand years ago during the Frost Era. My teeth gritted in frustration.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"What the hell... What kind of bullcrap is that? How is this possible?"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The knight attempted to offer an explanation, mentioning that some people had reported seeing the house intact with two older individuals inside. He admitted that he wasn't well-versed in magic and didn't have all the answers. With that, he took his leave to continue his patrol, leaving me to my thoughts.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Magic... Huh?" I muttered, contemplating the mysterious events unfolding around me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">In an attempt to make sense of it all, I drew my sword and inspected it closely. It appeared as new and undamaged as it should be.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Hm... Magic makes no sense," I mused, sheathing the sword back in its scabbard.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Resolute, I continued my walk through the kingdom, the feeling of impending danger never leaving my side. I noticed a few dogs on the streets, their expressions mirroring my own concern.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Even the dogs feel it," I remarked, resting my hand on the handle of my sword. I refused to be caught off guard.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As I continued my stroll, I found myself in the main district, where people went about their daily routines, seemingly oblivious to the underlying unease I felt. Amidst the bustling crowd, I spotted Beans walking without Bluma by his side. I called out to him, "Hey, Beans!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">He turned toward me, a smile lighting up his face. "Oh, hey Gwen! I was just about to look for you."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I crossed my arms and raised an eyebrow, prompting him to explain. Beans chuckled and told me that he had been going through the records of the prisoners and stumbled upon information about the men who stole Dragon Sap a month ago. Perplexed, I asked him about Dragon Sap, having never heard of it before.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans explained that it was a powerful sap found deep within the forest, possessing potent healing properties and celestial magic. He managed to acquire some from the barracks and gave it to the healer caring for Deta, our comrade who was still recovering.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"He should wake up a lot faster now!" Beans declared with a smile.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I couldn't help but smile in response, though I flicked his head hard for not doing it sooner. Beans winced, holding his forehead where I had flicked him.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c2">"What the heck, Gwen!" he exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Rolling my eyes, I retorted, "Well, in any case, when that pile of rocks wakes up, tell him to watch his back. I don't like waiting."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans chuckled and assured me he would relay the message. Before our conversation could continue, a knight approached us. His armor stood out from the others, adorned with golden trims and carvings, and he wore a red cap.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Squire Beans and Gwen, the King has requested an audience with you," he informed us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans turned to the knight, seeking more information before proceeding. The knight shook his head, stating that the king had yet to explain his reasoning but wanted to meet with both of us. After exchanging glances and subtle threats, I growled, "This better not be a waste of time."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The three of us made our way to the castle, where we found the king sitting on his throne in the grand hall. He greeted us with a boisterous laugh.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Hello, my friends! It's great to see you well."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans kneeled and bowed, addressing him as "My king" and expressing his honor to be in his presence. I followed suit with a small bow. The king smiled, urging us to stand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"It is not necessary to bow," he chuckled. "Beans, Gwen, please step forward."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans promptly rose and approached the king, while I took my time, not one to rush. Once we stood in front of him, the king rose from his throne.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Gwen, as one of the heroes who saved us from the dragon beneath the kingdom, I, King Solace, grant you the title of Surco of Sumring. It is a title bestowed upon those with great honor and skill."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I couldn't help but smile at the recognition.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Surco, huh? I'll take that," I replied, and we shared a chuckle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Then, the king turned his attention to Beans. "And Squire Beans, you have served this kingdom faithfully for many years, and I believe you have not been given the credit you deserve."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I glanced at Beans, noting his soft smile and respectful posture with hands behind his back. The king continued, drawing a decorative sword from his side.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"I hereby bestow upon you the rank of Surco and name you Royal Knight to the King!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Tears welled up in Beans' eyes as he expressed his gratitude. "Thank you, m'Lord. This... means so much to me." The king smiled, patting Beans on the shoulder and whispering something into his ear that made him blush. Beans whispered a response, eliciting a chuckle from the king.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"You're lucky my wife is a little... blind to these things."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Before our joyous moment could linger, the ground beneath us shook, followed by screams echoing through the castle. Instantly, my instincts kicked in, and I assumed a combat-ready stance. Beans drew his axe, and we both prepared for a fight.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The king turned to the knight who had accompanied us and instructed him to take his daughter to the safe house. With urgency in his voice, he addressed us, "We must hurry! That came from my wife's quarters!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Beans interjected, suggesting the king go with his daughter for her safety. Unfazed, the king shed his cape and silk clothes, revealing heavy-plated armor adorned with gold and rubies. "I can care for myself, but my wife is in danger," he asserted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Before Beans could argue further, I took charge, sprinting toward the stairs. "Then you better keep up!" I called, determination fueling my every step.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The king, resolute, ran after me, while Beans sighed but followed suit. Together, we raced to the floor where the commotion had originated and barged into a room. There, we witnessed a harrowing scene—the Queen held a knight's lifeless body in the air, half of her own body consumed by flames.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Luna! What is going on?" the king called to his wife, his voice laden with concern.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Slowly, the Queen turned toward him, her eyes filled with an otherworldly fire. She let out a blood-curdling scream as a pillar of purple fire incinerated the knight she had been holding.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I clenched my fists, ready to engage in battle, but the king stepped in front of us, his voice commanding, "Do not harm her!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">He then approached his wife, removing his chestplate and extending his arms in an attempt to embrace her. "My love... Please come here," he pleaded.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">With a malevolent smile, the Queen tossed aside the sword she had used to kill the knight. "He was always too soft for his own good," she taunted, reveling in her newfound power.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">We fought the Queen throughout the castle. She easily defeated Beans and sent me flying across the room. As I got back up, she placed chains and a muzzle on Beans, happily sighing. She formed several small balls of purple fire, tossing them out the window. I assumed that’s when the beasts began to emerge from the ground, terrorizing the people.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">She turned back to me. "Come now, dear, don't make a poor decision here. My offer still stands. You can rule with me, and together we can fund that part of us that's missing..."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I gritted my teeth. "Yeah right... Your missing piece is this bull. I don't want mine if that's how I’ll be."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The Queen sighed. "Oh this...? It's close, but not quite what I'm searching for."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I took a firm stance and readied my blade. "I think I'll pass."</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The Queen frowned. "What a poor choice." She then grinned, and Bluma emerged from around a corner, her eyes glowing red.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The two of them charged at me. I managed to block the attack, but the force sent me flying through the floor. As I was still falling, Bluma somehow caught up, swung her sword, and cut my leg, sending me flying out a door.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">My ears rang from the sheer power she had, but once I regained my hearing, I heard a familiar voice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Gwen!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I looked over, wincing in pain. "Bushy!? You're alive? Ah!"</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I tried not to react to the pain, attempting to stand, but the deep wound caused me to fall back down.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">"Gwen, don’t get up! Let me heal you! Also, what's going on?"</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c5 c8 c6 c14"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16 c8 c6 c14">Present</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c5 c8 c6 c14"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Deta walked over to me, and I quickly explained. He healed my leg, and we parted ways. I don’t know how, but he convinced me to leave and help people outside. Once I did, I found myself exactly where I am now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">As I returned to the present, we had finally managed to get the group of stragglers into the arena where the town had gathered. Just as I walked past the entrance, a knight called out, "Alright! That's everyone!"</span><hr/></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><h5 class="c7 c23" id="h.qsh70q"><span class="c21">CHAPTER 22</span><span class="c13 c8">                                                                                                                    Grand Escapism</span></h5><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c42 c8 c14 c22"></span></p><p class="c20"><span class="c16 c8 c6 c14">Deta’s View</span></p><p class="c20 c9"><span class="c5 c8 c6 c14"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Beans stared at Bluma in disbelief. "Bluma… is that really you?" As the mask fell away, her true identity was revealed. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">She reached out, softly touching Beans as she answered, "Yes… Squishy." </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Her face, still had her four golden eyes but also soft, black freckles, giving her an unexpectedly vulnerable appearance. Her gentle nature contradicted the cold, emotionless persona her mask had created. Bluma lowered her gaze, seeming embarrassed, but Beans rushed over and embraced her tightly, surprising her.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"You're free from that dreadful mask..." Beans murmured, his eyes filled with emotion. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Bluma looked at him, her own eyes wide with disbelief. "You’re… happy?" she asked, her voice trembling. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Beans laughed, shaking his head. "Yes!  Before you didn't have a choice. But now, you do. And now I get to see your beautiful face."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Tears filled Bluma’s eyes as she hugged him tightly. "I...love… you"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">The two held each other for a moment, their embrace firm and unyielding. But just then, the ground shook, and the deafening sound of buildings collapsing outside reached us. We snapped our attention to the chaos.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Deta, we need to get to the arena! The townspeople should be there!" Beans called.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I nodded, agreement quick, and we sprinted from the castle, only to find the town reduced to ashes. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Magma monsters ravaged everything in their path. "Hurry! Follow me!" Beans dashed toward the arena, but Bluma scooped him up and ran faster, leaving me to follow closely along the castle wall to avoid detection by the beasts. Their raw power was captivating—but terrifying.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"I sent Gwen out there. She’s fine, right?" I turned back to Beans and Bluma. “I was just about to say—”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Beans cut in before I could finish, already reading my thoughts.. "Don’t worry, Deta. Gwen knows where the arena is, and she’s probably already there. But for now, we need to reach it before the knights evacuate everyone—or we won’t catch up!"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I was surprised by his understanding but nodded. Nothing about this situation surprised me anymore. "Then what are we waiting for? Let’s move!" I called, and Bluma picked up her pace, catching me slightly off guard.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">As we rounded a corner, we spotted a group entering a door set into the castle’s wall. A familiar dark-skinned woman entered last, her sword at her side. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Gwen!" I called. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">As I approached the door to follow her inside, Beans and Bluma swiftly joined me, closing the door behind them. Bluma took a piece of paper from a stone box and placed it on the door, transforming it into solid stone, then gave a nod to Beans.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Beans adjusted his grip on his axe and muttered, "Alright... let’s go."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Together, we ran deeper into the catacombs.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">After a while, we arrived at a fork in the road—left or right. Beans was deep in thought, trying to make the decision. I asked him, "Which way do we go?" </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Bluma stepped up, patted his head, and smiled. "Let’s go left," she suggested.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">We moved down that path only to find ourselves at another fork. Gwen sighed, "It hasn’t even been five minutes, and we’re already lost." Beans took a moment, then considered our options—forward, left, or right—before a strange sound broke through the air.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">I nodded. "Yes, I hear it." The eerie sound grew louder, and from the left, a pack of wolves emerged, their flesh hanging loosely from their bones.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Beans turned to us, urgency in his voice. "Everyone, down the right passage!" he commanded. The people around us quickly began to flee down the passage. He turned to Bluma and me. "You two stay with them. Bluma knows the way, and Deta, you can hold your own!"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I was startled. "What? You and Gwen are staying? Let me help!" I protested.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Beans met my eyes with an unshakable determination. "You’ll be more helpful protecting the people. Go now. We can handle this." </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">I stood there for a moment, then finally agreed. Bluma and I ran towards the group, and she glanced back, asking,</span><span class="c5 c34">"Deta, can you stay in the back? Make sure-"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c34">"-Nothing sneaks up on us from behind?" I finished for her, understanding her meaning. "Sure. No problem"</span><span class="c5"> </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">She gave a small smile and nodded. I stayed at the back, staff in hand, my senses alert for any threats lurking in the shadows.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Our footsteps echoed through the narrow tunnel as we pushed forward. The flickering torchlight cast shifting shadows along the damp walls, and for a while, no one spoke.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Eventually, the pace of the group began to ease. The panic in our breathing faded into heavy, tired exhales. When we reached a small open chamber, the group slowed to a cautious walk. A few glanced back, eyes wide but calming. It felt safer here—just enough to let the tension fray at the edges.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Boots slapped stone as someone jogged to catch up. Beans, cheeks flushed and breath uneven, rejoined us, falling into step beside Bluma. He wiped a hand across his forehead and gave her a small grin, his eyes scanning everyone with a wary kind of relief.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Bluma’s gaze softened as she looked at him, then flicked back to the passage ahead.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">One man noticed my staff and, with a skeptical look, asked, "Why are you carrying a stick? What good will that do?"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">The woman next to him immediately slapped his shoulder, scolding him. "Jim, quit it." </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Jim and I shared a brief chuckle. "It’s fine, ma’am. But you can trust Jim. This little twig has saved me more than once," I reassured them.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Jim raised an eyebrow. "That twig? That's a bold statement."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">As we continued walking, the group suddenly turned left, and I stopped.<br/> "Well, here—see this rock?" I pointed at a rock about the size of a butternut squash.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Jim glanced at it. "Yeah? What about it?"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">With a smile, I tapped the rock with my staff. It glowed green and flew into the air. "See?" I said, demonstrating.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Jim chuckled. "So it's enchanted. Not bad."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Beans’ head snapped toward him. "Not bad? That’s what you’ve got to say?" He gestured sharply at the hovering rock. "That staff's saved more lives than you’ve had hot meals. Maybe show a little respect before you call it ‘not bad.’"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Jim raised an eyebrow, clearly caught off guard. "I was complimenting it."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Beans huffed. "Sure didn’t sound like it."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2"> Bluma reached out and gently tugged at his sleeve. He quieted but kept his glare on Jim until the rock slowly lowered back to the ground.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Just as we were about to continue, a man came running toward us. "Deta, the lady up front asked for you to come up quickly," he informed me. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">I nodded, thoughts racing. </span><span class="c5 c6">What lady? Wait… do they not recognize Bluma?</span><span class="c2"> The realization startled me, but then I considered that it might be better if they didn’t, especially considering what had happened earlier with her possession.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">I r</span><span class="c2">eached the front and saw Bluma a few yards ahead, bent down and inspecting something on the ground. I thanked the messenger and approached her. "What’s going on?" I asked.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Bluma looked up at me as she stood. "Monster remains," she replied.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I glanced down at what she was studying—a scattering of bones and feces. "Ew," I muttered, remembering the box I had glimpsed back in the Underworld, which sent a cold shiver down my spine.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Bluma pointed ahead. "There’s a dead end. Take the group there, then come back, and we’ll scout ahead."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I nodded in understanding. "Got it. By the way, it’s nice to hear you talk a bit more," I remarked with a smile.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Bluma smiled back, brushing a strand of hair behind her ear. I followed her instructions, leading the group to the dead end. The space was large enough for everyone to settle in comfortably. "Alright, stay here for a moment! We’ll scout the next area!" I announced.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">The men nodded. "Okay, we’ll wait here," they replied.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I gave them a reassuring smile before jogging back toward Bluma. "Alright," I said, letting out a breath. "Let’s see what’s ahead."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">As we continued down the corridor, a strange sound filled the air—a piercing scream, followed by a deafening roar. My grip tightened on my weapon as we cautiously advanced. When we reached a corner, we peeked around it, and I froze.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">A horse, rearing up on its hind legs, bellowed in fury. Beside it stood a chest with red eyes and sharp teeth—its monstrous form shifted before us.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Bluma, it’s a shifter!" I exclaimed, and she nodded in agreement. "And… a horse?" I raised an eyebrow, confused. Ready to defend ourselves, I gripped my staff tighter, but Bluma grabbed my arm just before I could charge forward. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Stop, look," she whispered urgently.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I followed her gaze and noticed the shifter wasn’t facing the horse. Instead, it seemed fixated on something further down the hall, obscured from view. Then, a massive, purple, spear-like object suddenly shot out from the shadowed passage, snatched the shifter, and dragged it away with agonizing screams.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">As the shifter was pulled into the unknown, the horse dropped down on all fours and charged toward us. We quickly pressed ourselves against the wall, watching as it rounded the corner. Spotting us, the horse skidded to a halt, startled, and reared up on its hind legs, attempting to strike.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Whoa! Whoa! Calm down! It’s okay!" I shouted, and surprisingly, my voice had a calming effect. The horse paused for a moment. That’s when I realized who it was.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Rubert?" I asked, astonished.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"I say! It’s so lovely to meet you again!" Rubert's familiar, boisterous voice filled the hallway. I couldn’t help but chuckle. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Rubert!" I rushed forward, throwing my arms around him in a hug. "It’s so good to see you!"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">He chuckled, but then looked at Bluma. "Another female? You can’t seem to keep a mate around, can you?" Rubert’s comment took me by surprise, and I quickly laughed it off.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"What? No! She’s someone else’s mate. We were just scouting the area," I clarified, turning to reassure Bluma.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Her expression was one I recognized from Gwen when we left the cave—though this time, Bluma's face turned a deep red. "M… mate?" she asked, clearly caught off guard.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Ah! Sorry, let me explain!" I quickly intervened. "I have a gift of speaking to animals with a certain level of intelligence. Rubert here has been curious about you—well, about humans in general— we met several months ago when I first came to the kingdom."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Bluma blinked, processing the information. "I see," she said. "Ask him about... the monster."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Smiling, I turned to Rubert and asked, "So... Do you know anything about the one who attacked the shifter?"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Ah, the vicious beast I scared off!" Rubert’s chest puffed out in pride. "It was a shifter, unlike anything I’ve ever seen!"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I chuckled and clarified, "No, not the shifter. The one that impaled it."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Rubert huffed, an amused glint in his eye. "Ah, yes. The wall itself. That’s a giant shifter!"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Silent contemplation engulfed me as I processed the revelation—a giant shifter. I turned to Bluma, asking, “Is there any way around it?”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Bluma's response came swiftly and flatly, “No.”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">It wasn’t the answer we had hoped for. “How are we going to pass it? We have to go that way to get out, right?” I pressed, seeking a solution.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Bluma nodded. "We should go back and... plan."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">With a sigh, we retraced our steps to rejoin the others. Upon our return, the group was eagerly awaiting news. Not wanting to give them the full truth, we simply told them a formidable monster blocked our path, and we would need to wait for Beans and Gwen before taking any action. Though disappointed, they didn't lose hope.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">About an hour passed before Gwen and Beans appeared around the corner, relief washing over me.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">“We found you guys, finally,” Gwen exclaimed, her smile easing my worry, though it quickly faded as the weight of the giant shifter settled back into my thoughts.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Beans approached Bluma, while Gwen came to me. “What’s bugging you, bushy? Another snail?” Beans teased, pulling a chuckle from me.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">“Well...” I began, explaining the situation.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2"> After some thought, we devised a plan. The group was informed, and the two eldest members were helped onto Rubert’s back. I shifted into my Celeste Elk form, carrying the young children as we made our way toward the inevitable encounter with the shifter.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">“Do you remember the plan?” Beans asked as I jogged ahead, and I nodded.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">“Alright. As soon as you can, take a left, then a right. Wait for us there. We don’t know what else lurks in these catacombs,” he added, his tone serious.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">Gwen</span><span class="c2"> gripped one of my antlers to steady herself as I sprinted toward the corner where the shifter lay in wait. The moment we reached it, the enormous shifter’s mouth opened wide, revealing rows of jagged teeth and a purple tongue that lashed at us. Gwen swiftly dismounted from my back, her sword glowing vibrant red. With a precise slash, she cut the tongue, causing the creature to shriek, its wails shaking the surroundings.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Rubert and the others sprinted to our side, and we snapped into formation, weapons ready. The battle erupted. Gwen’s sword blazed, Bluma’s shone with a white light, and Beans charged in swinging an ax. Gwen and Bluma met the shifter’s strikes head-on, parrying with sharp precision.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">For a while, we held our ground. But the shifter adapted—fast. It broke through our line and ensnared several of us. Gwen shouted something in a language I didn’t recognize, her voice raw with urgency.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">When we finally broke past the creature, half our group lay behind. Those of us who survived stood in silence, grief pulling at the edges of everything.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Beans exhaled a heavy sigh. “This didn’t go as we wanted,” he muttered.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Gwen scanned the group, frustration etched into her face. She stepped forward, raising her voice above the sorrowful murmurs. “Hey! What are you all whining about? This isn’t the time to wallow in self-pity! Yes, you've lost family and friends, but if you don’t pull yourselves together, you’ll join them! Life doesn’t stop when you face loss! You didn’t come here to die! Stand up—keep moving! The sun will shine again! If you want to live, keep fighting!”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">As Gwen spoke, the pain in her eyes was evident. These weren’t just words—they were a part of her, words she had carried her whole life. The group slowly rose to their feet, and </span><span class="c5">some of the young adults ventured off further down the corridors on their own</span><span class="c2">. The elderly, children, and parents stayed behind.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Alright, let’s continue and find a way out, so you can reclaim your lives," Gwen declared. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">With that, Beans led the way, and the faint sound of distant cries reached our ears. Gwen and I hurried ahead to investigate, discovering several young adults trapped inside a jelly-like cube.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">One of them noticed their presence and cried out, pleading, "Please save us! We can't escape!" </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Gwen approached the young man and asked, "Did your friends abandon you?"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2"> As he struggled, the young man’s clothes began to dissolve. In anguish, he cried out, "Please, it's getting more painful! I don't want to die!" Tears streamed down his face.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Gwen grabbed him by the hair and yanked him out of the cube. "Satisfied?" she asked, watching him collapse to the ground. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Thank you! Thank you!" he shouted, trying to hug her, but Gwen swiftly punched him in the gut. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">“Now go free, your friends.” She returned to me, muttering under her breath. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I chuckled. “Still not a fan of hugs?”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Gwen rolled her eyes. "I don’t trust him."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">“Do you trust me?” I asked, his grin widening.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Gwen sighed but smiled, walking away.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">“Hey, I didn’t get my answer!</span><span class="c5">” I c</span><span class="c2">alled after her, before turning to help the others who were still trapped. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">As Beans' group returned, the young adults decided to join us, trailing behind through the winding maze of catacombs. The twists and turns were confusing, and I quickly lost track of our path. Every so often, we came across more individuals—some ensnared in jelly cubes, others fast asleep at dead ends. We invited those we found to join us, though a few stubbornly insisted they could manage on their own.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">We pressed onward. The further we went, the more we saw people collapse from exhaustion. We halted, allowing Beans and Bluma to investigate while Gwen and I stayed behind, guarding the group.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"I can't believe they're having all the fun without us. Why can't I go with them?" Gwen muttered.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I chuckled. "I think you’re the only one who finds danger exciting."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">She smirked. "What? I take pride in the scars I earn from battle!"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I smiled. "Try not to go overboard. I don’t want you getting hurt."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Gwen playfully punched my shoulder. "Oh, look who’s talking! You were dead for a month! Do you have any idea how worried we all were?"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I leaned in, voice low and amused. "Oh, so you were worried about me?"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">“Tch, of course I was! We still have a debt to settle!”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I chuckled. "Is that the only reason?"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Gwen groaned. "You're such a blockhead, you know that?"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I patted my chest. "Indeed, and it's a badge I wear proudly."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">We shared a laugh before Beans and Bluma returned. "Alright, we’re mostly clear, but let’s stay alert," Beans warned, eyeing the group.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Yeah, yeah. Don’t get your ax in a twist, squirt," Gwen joked, prompting Beans to retort.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">As hours dragged on, we took turns leading the way. I began to question whether we were lost for good, but kept my concerns to myself. Along the way, we fought off various monsters, doing our best to protect the survivors. Gwen stretched after plunging her sword into a zombie-like wolf. "These things are easy to beat... I just wish they didn’t come in such large packs," she commented.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I picked up my staff, scanning the area. "True. The more trouble we encounter, the harder it is to keep everyone safe." </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Gwen nodded. "Exactly."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">She handed me her sword to clean off the decaying blood.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">We kept moving, and soon we stumbled upon a doorway. A wave of hope washed over everyone. We flung it open, revealing a clearing in the woods. The survivors scattered, some collapsing onto the grass in relief. These weren’t seasoned adventurers; for some, this was the farthest they'd ever been from town.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"I missed grass," I murmured, sinking to the ground. The sunlight hit my leaves, turning them a vibrant green as I let out a contented sigh.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Gwen chuckled. “Bushy, I swear.”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Beans and Bluma sat beside us. “Well, we can rest here for a while," Beans suggested. "After that, we should head to a nearby town or village tomorrow.” </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Bluma nodded. "Sounds good, Squishy," she teased, patting his head.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I lay on my back, a soft smile on my face. "I’m just grateful to feel the sun again..."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">As the evening wore on, we set up camp and gathered large leaves to keep the children warm. The parents curled up with their kids, and the others snuggled together for warmth, grateful to be safe, at least for the moment.</span><hr/></p><p class="c4 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><h5 class="c7 c23" id="h.3as4poj"><span class="c21">CHAPTER 23</span><span class="c13 c8">                                                                                                             Shattered Kingdom</span></h5><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">The following morning, Beans gathered a few men and assigned each of them a task. Some were tasked with finding wood for a fire, others with scouting the area for trails, and the rest went hunting with the few daggers we had. Beans sighed as the groups split up, then returned to Bluma, Gwen, and me.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Alright, we need to figure out where we are. I sent some men to scout the area for trails," he said.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Bluma smiled and patted his head. "Thank you, Squishy."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Beans blushed, and Gwen and I couldn’t help but smile and chuckle.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Well Bushy" Gwen said, turning to me</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"We're not too deep in the woods. It should take us about a day to reach civilization if we go the right way." </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Beans paused before asking, "And you know the way?"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I smiled. "Well, I did grow up in the forest."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Beans turned to me, a mix of surprise and irritation on his face. "Why didn’t you say so sooner?!" he exclaimed. “I had just sent men into the woods blind when you could have prevented that!”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Scratching the back of my head, I gave an awkward smile. "I thought I had told you... Oops." My hand paused mid-scratch as a realization struck me. I glanced down at my hand, the glove cut. The wooden and stone flesh had fallen away, revealing pale skin similar to the others'. As my thoughts swirled, another worry crept in—I had left Rinn behind. He should’ve been dragged along with me; he could never stray far since I had claimed him.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Gwen noticed the concern etched on my face. With a groan, she unsheathed her sword. "Bushy, let’s find one of those groups and speed this up. I don’t want to stay here longer than we have to." She marched off without waiting for a response.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Beans gave me a reassuring smile. "Probably a good idea. The faster we gather supplies, the sooner we can find a safe place for these people to live." </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">His eyes shifted toward the survivors—mostly children with a handful of elders helping the mothers as best they could. Almost everyone had lost someone, whether in the catacombs or the earlier attack on the Kingdom.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I nodded and jogged after Gwen. "Hey, Gwen! Wait up!"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">She didn’t stop but glanced back as I caught up. Her determined expression stayed fixed, unwavering.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Let’s see," I said, pointing to a trail on the right. "Looks like they went this way."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">She paused, turning fully toward me, waiting silently as if leaving the choice to me. Feeling the pressure, I forced a small smile and started down the path. The quiet between us stretched until, finally, she spoke.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"So… how’s your hand doing?"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">The question caught me off guard. "Oh… uh, it’s fine, I guess? Just odd."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Her gaze lingered, urging me to say more.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"I think I might be able to use my magic to disguise it," I added, "like I did to you inside the giant worm."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I tried to chuckle, but the memory surfaced—the moment I’d died. The image of the glowing woman flashed in my mind, and I remembered the looks on everyone’s faces, especially Gwen’s, as they thought I was gone.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Her expression darkened as if the same memory had crossed her mind. Her eyebrows drew together, but she forced a smile. "Maybe! But hey, look—there are the people we’re looking for!"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">She strode toward the group of hunters, who stood chatting with daggers in hand.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Where are all the critters?" a burly man asked.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"There’s nothing out here," replied a wiry one.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Yeah, like those muscles of yours," teased another, prompting a burst of laughter.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Hey! Morons!" Gwen barked, bringing their conversation to a halt. "How do you expect to find prey when you’re louder than a twister?!"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I stifled a laugh and leaned closer. "Um, Gwen? Yelling probably doesn’t help either," I whispered.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">She hesitated but quickly straightened, brushing off the misstep. "Tch… Whatever. Do you think any forest creature hears a racket and thinks, 'Oooh, I should check that out?' No! They run because they don’t want to die."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Her pointed tone earned a glare from one of the men.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Now listen here, girly—" he began, but Gwen’s cold, piercing stare froze him mid-sentence.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I stepped in to diffuse the tension. "Let me explain how wolves hunt. They observe first—watch for tracks, follow scents, and, when close enough, they move in absolute silence to strike." I looked at the hunters. "Got it?"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Reluctantly, they nodded.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Good. Split into pairs and act like wolves. You'll have better luck."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">The men exchanged skeptical glances but eventually broke off into smaller groups.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Gwen turned to me, her stern expression softening just a little. Playful sarcasm coming off her voice. "Didn’t know we had a forest expert with us."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I chuckled. "Well, I did grow up in one."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">She sighed. "Let’s find some food ourselves. Come on."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">We ventured deeper into the woods, following faint signs of wildlife. The melodic chatter of songbirds filled the trees, but it took a while before we stumbled upon fresh tracks.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"This looks promising, doesn't it, Bushy?" Gwen knelt beside a set of large prints, her fingers tracing the edges. The tracks were massive—each hind paw about seven inches long, the forepaws slightly smaller. Each foot had five toes tipped with curved claws </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Looks like a bear," I grinned. Surveying the area, I added, "There’s no sign of smaller tracks, so it’s either a large male or a female without cubs."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Gwen patted my back with a smile. "Nice job, hunter. Let’s get some meat."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I opened my mouth to respond but stopped when shouts erupted nearby. A low, unmistakable roar followed.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Looks like they found the bear for us!" Gwen smirked as we dashed toward the commotion.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">We burst into a clearing to find half the men huddled against a cliff wall. Towering over them, a grizzly bear stood on its hind legs, ready to charge. Just as it lunged, I leaped forward, swinging my staff hard against the back of its skull. The bear collapsed with a thud, and Gwen followed up with a swift crossbow bolt to its head.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">She pulled out the bolt with a sigh and shot a pointed look at the trembling hunters. "Careful—you wouldn’t want to be bear-chow."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I retrieved her bolt, inspecting the bear. "Definitely a male," I muttered, noting the broad head and muscular frame. "Let’s get him back to camp and skin him."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">The men scrambled to retrieve their dropped daggers, then joined us to haul the bear’s massive body back. Once we returned, the camp was bustling—others had brought back a wild boar and were busy skinning it.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Boar meat, huh? Not bad!" Gwen said, dropping the bear. "You guys might actually know what you're doing."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">The next few minutes passed in a flurry of activity. The hunters divided meat, leather, and furs into manageable bundles, wrapping everything in shirts and rope before securing it to Rubert’s back.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I noticed Beans deep in conversation with the men and walked over. He turned, his voice laced with concern. "Scouts found a trail heading west—well-worn, but a bit far."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Why's that a problem?" I asked, puzzled.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Such trails often attract thieves and bandits," he explained, shrugging.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Ah." That made sense. We discussed a plan: Beans and Bluma would lead, while Gwen and I guarded the rear. The children stayed protected in the middle of the group, surrounded by adults.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">As we started moving, Gwen fell into step beside me. "Bushy," she said suddenly, her voice low, "when I woke up, I took this off you. Thought you’d want it back."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">She reached into her pouch and handed me a small object. Confused, I extended my hand. When she dropped it into my palm, I realized—it was the soul stone. I stared at it in silence before looking at her. She deliberately avoided meeting my gaze.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"I thought I’d lost this," I said quietly, clutching the stone. "Thank you for keeping it safe."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Gwen’s lips twitched into a faint smile, but she kept her eyes ahead. And responded in almost a whisper. "Don’t mention it." </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I shifted the soul stone in my hand, feeling its weight. “You know, I think you deserve an explanation about this.”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Gwens eyes looked from me and rested on the soul stone in my hand. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"It’s the main reason I got everyone tangled in this mess."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">She then made a swift remark "First of all, this isn’t your fault. You didn’t make the Queen go mad, did you?"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I shook my head.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"And second," she continued, her tone firm but kind, "you didn’t drag me into this, Deta. I’m here because I chose to be." She offered me a faint smile, but her voice was steady.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Her words caught me off guard, easing a burden I hadn’t realized I was carrying. I smiled back. "Thanks, Gwen."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Taking a deep breath, I began. "This is a soul stone. It’s vital to Randeths—it keeps us alive." Gwen nodded slightly, her curiosity clear.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"When a Randeth dies, their soul stone buries itself underground to protect itself. It remains hidden until another Randeth is born, channeling its magic into the new life. Its power is why other species, especially humans, seek them out—to absorb their magic. Even the weakest human could overpower me if they used one against me."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Gwen’s gaze lingered on the golden stone. "So, it’s that powerful?"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I nodded. "Yes, and dangerous. If too much of its magic is drained while it’s above ground, it won’t have enough left to create a new Randeth. I’m hoping Vomete and I can ensure its continuation when I get back—before it’s too late."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Too late? What do you mean?" Gwen tilted her head, concern etched into her features.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I hesitated. "Without enough magic, there are supposed to be other ways to preserve its purpose, but... I don’t fully understand them yet."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">When I glanced at Gwen, her gaze had shifted away. She wasn’t meeting my eyes, which was unlike her.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I opened my mouth to ask if something was wrong when she abruptly shushed me. "Quiet... We’re being followed."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Instantly, I scanned the trees, but I saw no movement. Shifting my focus lower, I watched the bushes.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Gwen’s hand tightened on her sword, and a faint green glow radiated from my hand.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Nothing stirred.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"It might be as Beans said," I whispered. "With a group this size, I doubt anyone would be foolish enough to attack outright."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Maybe," Gwen murmured. "But I’m not letting my guard down."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">We both fell silent. Behind us, faint muttering rippled through the group.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"I can’t believe we’re stuck out here in these woods," a man muttered. "We had gold and silver back at the kingdom!"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Another man joined in. "Better to have died in our homes than in this awful place."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Exactly," the first man added. "And the king? Weak. No surprise he couldn’t save anyone—"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Enough, Ronald!" a woman snapped, her sharp voice cutting him off. "We’re lucky to be alive. Don’t make it worse for the rest of us."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">The grumbling ceased, but the unease lingered.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I exhaled, ready to whisper to Gwen, when a gravelly voice growled from behind us.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Hey! It’s the mammals!"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Gwen and I spun around. Emerging from the underbrush was a towering orange Basilisk-folk, gold eyes blazing with hatred.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">More followed—seven in total, armed with swords and spears.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"They killed the king lizard! Kill them!" the leader hissed, pointing a jagged blade at us.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Everyone, run!" I shouted to the group.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Screams filled the air as our companions bolted. Gwen’s sword glowed crimson as she unsheathed it, and I steadied my staff, the surge of adrenaline sharp and electric.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Without a second thought, we charged to meet them.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Four of the Basilisk-folk leaped into the sky, their swords aimed at Gwen. With swift precision, she blocked their attacks. "These jerks are pissed!" she shouted, her voice strained with effort.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">As the remaining three advanced, one leaped over me, and the other two aimed their swords at me. I barely dodged both blades, their tips grazing the air on either side of me. But the third one tripped me with its tail, sending me crashing to the ground.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"I noticed!" I grunted, swinging my staff in a wide arc. It collided with the legs of two Basilisk-folk, sending them tumbling, their heads cracking against the ground. The third one quickly jumped back, giving me the chance to regain my footing.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Meanwhile, Gwen pushed back against the four attacking her, her sword glowing with intense heat. She parried their blows effortlessly and, with a swift motion, launched a fiery projectile that struck two of the Basilisk-folk, hurling them into a tree.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">The remaining two tried to trap her with a pincer maneuver, but Gwen planted her sword in the ground, using it as leverage to launch herself above them. "These guys are getting on my nerves!" she growled as she evaded a wild swing, then grabbed one of their arms and flung it over the other, sending them both sprawling.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Same here!" I called, punching my fist into the earth. Tree roots shot up from the ground, wrapping tightly around the Basilisk-folk I was fighting. Despite their desperate thrashing, the roots held them fast.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I glanced toward Gwen, who was facing the two Basilisk-folk who had just recovered from her fiery attack. She was clearly tiring, but her resolve never wavered. One of the monsters swung at her, and she expertly grabbed its sword arm, twisting it and sending the weapon flying. She followed up with a quick slash, stabbing it through the chest, then swiftly decapitating the other.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Breathing heavily, Gwen scanned the area, but before we could speak, Rubert appeared, running down the path.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I raised my hand to stop him. "Hold on, Rubert! What’s going on?"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Ambush," he panted. "The group’s under attack."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Hop on, Rubert!" I said to Gwen. She nodded, jumped onto his back, and he galloped off. I followed in my Celeste Elk form, sprinting through the woods as fast as I could.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">When we reached the group, we found chaos. Some of the men, women, and </span><span class="c5">children had been wounded</span><span class="c2">, and many were crying. I quickly shifted back to human form and joined Gwen as we hurried to Beans.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Beans! What happened?" Gwen asked urgently.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Where were you?" Beans snapped, his face strained with worry.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"We were attacked from behind," I said, cutting him off. "A group of Basilisk-folk tried to ambush us."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Beans growled in frustration, but his anger melted into concern when Bluma walked up, her arms covered in cuts.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Need… safety," she said calmly, placing a hand on his shoulder. He sighed, nodded, and turned back to the group.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Minutes later, we moved the survivors to a clearing. Beans and I worked quickly, tending to the wounded. Beans took care of minor cuts, while I focused on more severe injuries, offering healing where I could. As I treated a woman’s arm, she couldn’t stop crying.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">Assuming it was the pain, I tried to comfort her. "</span><span class="c5">You’re doing great. Almost done here. Can you tell me what happened?</span><span class="c2">"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Through her sobs, she explained that as the group walked, a band of Grey Dwarves and Elves had attacked and taken the children. The rage that bubbled up inside me was almost too much to bear, but I forced a smile.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">"Don’t worry," I said softly. "</span><span class="c5">I will get them back.</span><span class="c2">"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">She clutched my hand, her tears of fear turning to gratitude. "Thank you..."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">After bandaging her wounds, I walked over to Gwen, who was standing guard. Her eyes narrowed as I approached, and I noticed the leaves in my hair turning dark red.</span></p><p class="c30"><span class="c2">"Bushy... What’s going on?" she asked, suspicion in her voice.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I cut her off. "Out. Are you coming?"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Gwen hesitated for only a moment before nodding, quickly finding someone to take her post.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Wait, Deta! What’s going on?" she called, catching up with me.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I didn’t answer right away. A ball of fire flared in my hand.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Their kids were stolen by,” I balled my fist, suffocating the fire that had formed in my hand as I spat, “Filth from the Underworld," I replied flatly, cursing them.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">As soon as the word came out of my mouth, Gwen shot a surprised glance at me. "You’re not kidding..."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I didn’t respond. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Okay, let’s go." She steeled herself and followed me into the woods. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">We found the place of the attack, searching for any sign of where the kidnappers had gone. After a tense moment, Gwen swung her sword, sending a wave of fire through the trees. A branch fell, and a man in a dark robe with a mask dropped to the ground.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Gwen was on him instantly, her sword pressed to his neck, while I positioned my staff threateningly at his back.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Tell us... What happened here?" Gwen demanded, her voice low and dangerous.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">The man was a member of the Dark Elves and Dwarves, and he admitted they were capturing slaves to sell in the Underworld. He provided us with the location of their camp, and, to our fury, </span><span class="c5">confirmed they had seven children in their custody</span><span class="c2">, with plans to send them to the Underworld by nightfall. We didn’t waste any time. We tied the man up and headed toward their camp.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Upon arrival, we saw the patrol—a mix of Elves and Dwarves—and overheard one of the Elves shouting at the captured children. Gwen’s anger flared, and she was about to charge in when I stopped her, pointing to a cave on the other side of the camp.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">"That’s where they’re keeping the </span><span class="c5">train</span><span class="c2">," I whispered.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">Gwen nodded, and we slipped toward the cave. There it was—</span><span class="c5">the slave train</span><span class="c2">, smaller than the one in the underworld but heavily secured. We hid as a Gray Dwarf emerged from one of the cars. As he passed, Gwen swiftly struck, decapitating him before dragging the body out of sight.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"We need to remain stealthy," I reminded her, my voice urgent.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"One less to deal with," she muttered, dragging the body behind a bush.</span></p><p class="c30"><span class="c2">"Let’s sabotage the train. It’ll buy us time."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I nodded, following her inside the cave.</span></p><hr/><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><h5 class="c7 c23" id="h.1pxezwc"><span class="c21">CHAPTER 24</span><span class="c13 c8">                                                                                                                             Hope is fragile</span></h5><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I followed Gwen into the dark cavern, dimly lit by mushrooms glowing faintly on the train tracks from the Underworld. The wood of the train was dark brown, almost gray. We headed straight for the metal bar connecting the two cars. Gwen unsheathed her sword, its edge glowing red-hot. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Make sure no one sees us, Bushy," she said.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Got it," I muttered, turning around. Gwen swung her blade, the red glow slicing through the metal, slowly cutting the bar in half.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">With a chuckle, she sheathed her sword. "This should annoy them." She turned to me, a grin tugging at her lips. "Bushy, help me search for this thing."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">As Gwen moved to the front cart, which was chained shut, I noticed a small box with a flap on top attached to the outside of the car. With my attention divided, Gwen struggled with the chains. I pulled the lock from my pocket and smiled, holding up the key.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">She gave me an irritated glance. "What kind of idiots... Whatever. Let's see what's in here." We pried open the door to reveal several crates marked with red Dwarvish labels, reminiscent of those from the first train. A chill crawled up my spine. A rope dangled from the wall outside, passing through a hole, tied to some metal object. Glowing yellow mushrooms scattered across the cavern.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Gwen growled. "Nothing." With a swift motion, she drew her sword, its red glow cutting through the rope. A deep, thunderous roar reverberated from deeper within the cavern, and the rope retreated toward the wall.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Shoot..."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">We whirled around as a group of dark Elves and Dwarves charged us. Gwen smirked. "Well, so much for stealth."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Yeah, now we have an excuse to kill them for stealing the kids!" I said. She dashed forward, sword blazing. As I ran after her, something cold seized my heart—crying echoed from the other cart.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">I bolted toward it, desperate hope mixing with dread. The door flung open, revealing seven</span><span class="c5"> children</span><span class="c2">, their skin bruised, their clothes torn and ragged. Chained to the walls of the car, they cowered under the weight of fear.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">A gray Dwarf was looming over a little girl, threatening her with a dagger. "Shut your mouth, girl! Or else I’ll cut it off!" His laughter echoed through the car as he lunged.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Before he could strike, I stormed forward, punching him square in the face. "You monster!" I yelled as I sent him flying out of the car. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Fury burned through my veins as I conjured a small ball of fire and hurled it at him. He cried out in pain as it struck him. I transformed into my Elk form, leapt onto him, and tossed him into the air. He crashed against the far wall and crumpled to the ground.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">I quickly reverted to my humanoid form and stepped toward the children, offering them a gentle smile to hide the fury welling inside. "It's going to be alright. We’ll get you back to your families, I promise. But first, I need to deal with the ones outside, okay?" They sobbed but nodded, murmuring desperately for their parents.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I met their gazes one last time before sprinting toward the camp. A group of six men was headed towards Gwen. Four drew scimitars while two set their sights on me. Upon seeing my Elk transformation, they hesitated, arming light crossbows. They fired, but the bolts bounced off harmlessly.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I didn’t waste any time. I closed the distance swiftly, impaling one with my horns. Blood spilled as he collapsed. I swung my focus to the other, who gripped his scimitar with trembling hands. Gwen’s fiery blade whistled through the air, cleaving down two attackers in one swift move. But two remained.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"You think a trick will save you?" one snarled, eyes hard with defiance.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"I’ll make it worse for you." Gwen planted her sword into the ground, then spun around, kicking one attacker down. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">The scimitar fell from his grasp. Before he could rise, she snatched it and hurled it toward the other. He dodged but stepped too far, letting his own sword fall out of reach. Gwen didn’t miss the opening, running across the gap and tackling him, disarming him in an instant. She snapped his arm with brutal efficiency. He cried out, swinging his weapon uselessly as Gwen used his body against him, hurling him aside. Then, she impaled him with his own scimitar.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">The last two assailants still stood, their clothes smoldering from Gwen’s fiery blade. Gwen grinned. "You’re in for a treat."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">The kidnapper I engaged couldn’t cut through my stone form. Desperate, he jabbed at my leg and scored a wound. Pain shot up my limb. My vision swirled, but I didn’t falter. My horns met him again, this time hoisting him into the air before slamming him to the ground.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">I cast a spell to summon stone armor </span><span class="c5">to shield my leg</span><span class="c2">, grateful for the protection as Gwen fought off the others. "Get out already!" she shouted, still struggling to retrieve her sword from the ground.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Together, we lifted the weapon free. "I know, Bushy! Let's go!"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">We ran to the train car, where Gwen quickly began breaking the chains that bound the children. I transformed into my Elk form once more, allowing the children to climb on my back. Gwen used what chains she could to secure them before we rushed out of the cavern.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">As we reached the edge of the camp, we were greeted by more enemies, weapons drawn. "Dang it..." Gwen grumbled, scowling. "Bushy, get the kids to safety! I'll hold them off!"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"I—I can't leave you!" I hesitated, my voice tightening. The weight of responsibility for the children on my back grounded me in that moment.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Gwen…" I felt her presence even as she fought. With a grim sigh, I turned and sprinted into the woods. My legs strained beneath the load. Behind me, I heard the clash of swords and the distant roars of battle.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Beans, Bluma, and the rest of the group were preparing to leave, unaware we’d even gone. "Alright, let's move!" Beans shouted as the group gathered.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Suddenly, a rustling in the bushes caught their attention. The sight of me, transformed into my Celeste Randeth form, drew an awestruck gasp.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Wait—what—A Randeth... They’re real?" Someone muttered in disbelief.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">I turned slightly, revealing the children.</span><span class="c2"> Several of the group rushed forward to assist me. Beans and Bluma were at my side in seconds.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Deta! What were you thinking? Where’s Gwen?" Beans demanded, a flicker of panic in his voice.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"She's still back there, fighting." I lowered my gaze, my heart heavy as the last child slid off my back. Turning to Bluma, I glanced up. "We have to go back…"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Stay behind. Get the children out of here, now!" Beans urged.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"No, I can’t." I shook my head firmly, and together, we dashed back into the woods, the tension mounting as each step quickened.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"We’re too late..." My words were strained as the acrid scent of smoke reached us. The camp was engulfed in flames.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Bluma and I ran through the wreckage, frantic. "Where are they?" I shouted.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Bluma kicked aside a collapsed beam, revealing the bodies of thugs I’d killed earlier, scattered around a broken cart.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">And then we found it: the shattered remnants of our battle—bloodstains on the floor, the door still half open. The train car was a mess.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">I scoured the campsite, frustration mounting with each moment that passed. No traces of Gwen. No sign of any of the others. </span><span class="c5 c6">I should have stayed... I should have helped,</span><span class="c2"> I thought, my anger bubbling over.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I let out a shaky breath, the weight of it all pressing down on me. Without thinking, I shifted back, the form that had been a shield falling away as sadness tugged at me.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Just then, someone shouted, "Halt! Stay where you are, fiend!"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I spun to face a man in armor holding Gwen’s sword. Fury surged through me. “Where did you get that?” I demanded, my voice thick with rage.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">The man scoffed. “That’s none of your concern. You’ll come with me, thug, and face the consequences for your crimes.”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c6">My crimes...</span><span class="c2"> The words seared through me like fire, snapping the control I’d been clinging to. “My crimes? The only crime I see here is you holding that sword!”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">I reached for my staff</span><span class="c2">, gripping it tightly. “It doesn’t belong to you! You can’t keep it!”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Nearby, I spotted three large stones. With all my strength, I smacked them with my staff which made them fly at the man, one striking him squarely in the face, knocking him to the ground. I moved fast, charging forward, staff raised high above my head. The man reached for Gwen’s sword, still struggling to recover, but when he tried to shield himself, he froze—Bluma stood between us, blocking my strike.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">“Deta…” she said, her voice low but firm, signaling me to halt.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I stared at her for a beat, my breath heavy with frustration and confusion, before reluctantly lowering my staff. Slowly, I reached for Gwen’s sword.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">“Hey! You can’t—” The guard’s protest was cut short when Bluma swung around, placing her blade against his neck with deadly precision.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">“Silence,” she commanded. Her glowing eyes pierced through him, and he fell silent. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">It was a struggle for her, the words fighting to come out, but Bluma managed to explain with some effort. "Friend," she said first, then hesitated. "Sword." The new two-word sentences were harder for her, but she made them work, her gaze steady despite the difficulty.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Realizing the danger of his position, the guard spoke reluctantly “I was patrolling when a pillar of fire appeared in the woods. Dark elves and dwarves were fighting. I called for backup. We subdued some of them, including the sword’s owner. She put up a fierce fight… she’s been arrested and is being interrogated.”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I clenched my fists, restraining myself from attacking him. Bluma, calm as ever, asked, “What will happen to her?”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">The guard shifted uncomfortably. "If she’s really your friend, her words won’t matter much. But with her aggression... it won’t end well"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Frustration broke free. “You idiot!” I shouted, raising the sword in anger.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Bluma shot me a sharp look before turning back to the guard. “Bring… us.”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">He hesitated, no doubt intimidated by Bluma’s presence, but eventually nodded “The town is… this way…”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">As we followed, I tried to steady myself. </span><span class="c5 c6">There’s a town nearby</span><span class="c5 c8 c6 c14">… if Gwen’s here, she’s alive… We’ll get her back…</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">A hand on my shoulder broke my focus. I turned to see Bluma smiling softly at me. “Gwen… return”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I nodded in gratitude. “Thank you, Bluma.”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">The guard suddenly announced, “</span><span class="c5">We’re here.</span><span class="c2">” </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">As we emerged from the trees, the sight of an open prairie greeted us. In the distance, a village lay nestled in the valley, the sounds of children’s laughter carried on the breeze. As we approached the gates, the guards at the entrance greeted us. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">The lead guard pointed toward the cells. “Your friend’s in here.”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Bluma’s four wary eyes scanned him. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Before we could reply, a loud crash echoed from within the prison. I laughed, my frustration easing. “I think he’s telling the truth,” I muttered, pushing the door open.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Inside, we found Gwen, shackled to the floor. But before we could move closer, she kicked one of the distracted guards at our feet, sending him sprawling.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">“Gwen!” I rushed to her. She turned, anger and confusion written across her face. “What the hell are you two doing here?”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">But when her eyes landed on the sword in my hand, a flicker of recognition softened her expression.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I walked over, used the sword to shatter the chains binding her. She wasted no time in reclaiming it. As the guard attempted to question us about our presence in the woods, Gwen rolled her eyes. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">“Maybe next time, you could just ask?” she quipped.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I stepped in to explain, “We’re leading survivors from an attack on Sumring.” The guards exchanged looks, clearly surprised.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">“If that’s the case,” one of them said, “we’ll help you find them. We’ll bring them here and see how much assistance we can offer.”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Before we could respond, a soft chuckle broke the strained silence, like a jagged knife to the chest. From the shadows of the room, a dark elf emerged, his smirk dripping with venom.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">“Well, well, well… You seem to be everywhere, Randeth,” he sneered, his voice a razor-sharp whisper.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Gwen’s body locked up, her muscles stiffening, her knuckles white on the hilt of her sword. Bluma's stance shifted, every fiber of her being taut with readiness, as if preparing for an imminent strike. But for me, it was like the world slowed—my Soul Stone buzzing in my ears as I recognized him.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">A cold scowl twisted across my lips. “</span><span class="c5">Adam...</span><span class="c2">” The name barely escaped my throat, but it was a full-on clash of shock and loathing.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">A cold ripple swept through the room—the air seemed to grow thicker, charged. A pulse of pure hatred coursed through Gwen and Bluma, and I could see them trembling with every inch of rage they had buried. </span><span class="c5 c8 c6 c14">He shouldn’t be alive… he’s dead…</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Without warning, a hairless purple tiger materialized at his side—its piercing yellow eyes glowing, its muscles rippling under its smooth, alien skin. The sight of the beast jolted us all, but it was Adam who held our full attention, his eyes glittering darkly as he scanned us.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">“</span><span class="c5">You do remember me...</span><span class="c2">” His voice oozed with mockery, the words meant to dig under our skin.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Without hesitation, Gwen and Bluma both drew their swords in unison, ready to strike. It was as if time stopped—the air between them was taut with the promise of violence. But Adam didn’t flinch. He only laughed, that haunting sound cutting through the tension like a knife through flesh.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">“See you around,” he sneered, his smug expression making every second drag like an eternity.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">And</span><span class="c2"> then, just as quickly as he’d come, he vanished—disappearing into thin air with his tiger, leaving us with the echo of his taunting voice lingering in the room.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">The silence that followed was suffocating. Gwen’s fury was palpable—her sword trembling slightly in her hand, her teeth clenched. Bluma’s gaze never wavered, locked on the spot where he had stood as if waiting for him to reappear. I stood frozen, fighting against a flood of emotions, none of them good.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Adam was supposed to be dead. He’d vanished after the massacre—never to be heard from again. The fact that he was here, standing in front of us, made every dark memory come rushing back in a cruel wave.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Gritting my teeth, I muttered under my breath, “Of course he had to be here...” </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">The guards exchanged glances, their curiosity piqued. “You know him?” one of them asked, his voice steady but edged with suspicion.</span></p><p class="c4 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c20"><span class="c16 c8 c6 c14">Gwen’s View</span></p><p class="c38 c9"><span class="c5 c8 c6 c14"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">The moment hung heavy between us, but I didn’t have time to dwell on it as we stepped outside the village and began our way toward the camp. As we walked, I recounted the past—our brief but devastating history with Adam. The guards listened with rapt attention, but I stayed quieter, lost in my own thoughts.<br/>        Beside me, Bluma slowed to match my pace, her gaze softening. “Are you okay?” she asked, her voice gentle, a stark contrast to the storm still raging in my chest.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I nodded quickly. “Yeah, I’m fine. I’ll have Bushy patch up my wounds later,” I said, though the strain in my voice was hard to hide—my usual fire dampened for the moment.        </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Bluma’s smile didn’t fade. She didn’t push, but instead asked, “Deta, hurt the guard…”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">At first, I just stared, confused. Then, my lips parted in a half-amused, half-disbelieving expression. “Hurt the gura—blah, I mean... guard!”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Bluma chuckled, and I couldn’t help but join in, a light laugh escaping me despite myself. My smile turned mischievous, eyes glinting with hidden meaning. “He was mad. You were hurt,” I said without hesitation.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Bluma’s expression shifted, teasing. “Funny. Bushy wouldn’t hurt anyone who isn’t a threat.”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I rolled my eyes at her, the corners of my mouth lifting into a grin. “Okay, sure. Bushy’s a big softie.”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Bluma’s eyebrow arched, her look playful. “Okay.”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">My brow furrowed at her response, something not quite sitting right. But Bluma merely chuckled, letting the moment pass as if nothing was wrong. I shook my head, turning my focus back on the path ahead, my mind buzzing as I processed everything.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">When we reached the camp, Beans was waiting with a group of people. Everyone had packed up, but the children—still in their sorry state—brought a sense of melancholy to the camp. Pain, fatigue, and coldness had taken their toll, and complaints and arguments filled the air as people scrambled for shelter. Beans looked visibly stressed, trying to figure out what to do when we emerged from the bushes behind him.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Hey there, Beans!" I called out.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Beans turned, his face lighting up with a wide smile. "You guys made it back!" he exclaimed, then his gaze shifted to the guards behind us. "Who are these guys?"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">The guards looked toward the group of arguing people and spoke up. "We are guards from the nearby village. Are these all the survivors?" Beans nodded, confirming they were.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">After a few tense minutes, the group calmed down, and the guards spoke to them. "People of Sumring, we deeply apologize for the struggles you've faced with your homes being destroyed. There is a town not far from here. If you'd like, you may follow us there and stay until you can get back on your feet."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">The guard looked at Beans, who smiled. Excitement spread across the group, and Beans called out, "Let's get moving, people!"</span></p><p class="c9 c38"><span class="c5 c8 c6 c14"></span></p><p class="c20"><span class="c16 c6">Deta’s View</span></p><p class="c38 c9"><span class="c5 c8 c6 c14"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">We all followed the guards back to the village. Laughter and excitement replaced the earlier tension, and I glanced at Beans, his bright smile signaling relief as his people would finally have somewhere to live. Bluma walked behind him, wearing a similar smile. Gwen, on the other hand, stood off to the side, gazing into the distance.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I approached her and asked, "Something bothering you, Gwen?"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">She looked at me and grinned. "Tch! Never in a million years, Bushy! I'm doing great. We can finally relax for once."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I chuckled. "Relax? I thought you enjoyed the stress of the journey."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Gwen rolled her eyes. "True, but a break every now and then doesn't hurt."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I smiled. "Wow, I never thought you'd want to stop."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Gwen chuckled, then glanced away for a moment. "Oh, Bushy..."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I looked at her, confused and concerned. "Yes?"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">Before I could comprehend what was happening, she suddenly turned around, and right in front of me was </span><span class="c5">a horrifying, bloodthirsty snail</span><span class="c2">. I let out a scream, jumped back, and fell to the floor, causing Gwen to burst into laughter.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Got ya!" she exclaimed, throwing the snail away and helping me up.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"What was that for?" I asked.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">She gently punched my shoulder. "You need to relax. You can't get pissed off every time I prank you."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I couldn't think of a suitable response, which made her smile. Then she walked away and joined Beans and Bluma.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"What just happened?" I wondered, shaking my head. "I'll figure it out later." I smiled and followed them to the front.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">After a few minutes, we finally escaped the forest and entered the town. The guards led us to a massive farm and knocked on the door of a sturdy, large building. When it opened, we were greeted by a giant Half-Orc wearing modest clothing. He looked at the guards, then at the large group of people, and asked, "What can I do for you?"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">The guards explained the situation, and the Half-Orc took us to a large barn, agreeing to let the group stay there temporarily, as it was the only place large enough to accommodate everyone. Gwen, Bluma, Beans, and I stood off to the side as everyone settled down, smiling and chatting. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">The Half-Orc approached us and said, "Say, how are the four of you holding up?" He smiled warmly.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I replied, "I think we're doing pretty good. And you?"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">His chuckle filled the air. "I'm doing just fine... But may I ask, do I know the four of you?"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">We exchanged confused glances, unable to recall who he was. He chuckled again. "Well, if not, my name is Albuquerque, but you can call me Ale."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">A smile broke across my face. "Ale! It's you!" I chuckled.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">This surprised him, but he quickly caught on. "So, I do know you! Now I remember! </span><span class="c5">You four were those kids who tried to fight the dragon! What happened to the four of you</span><span class="c2">?"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I chuckled, and Gwen spoke up, "Well, the overgrown lizard tossed us into the underworld."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Ale was shocked. "The underworld!? How did you escape?"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Beans interjected, "We managed to get a dark elf to escort us."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Gwen rolled her eyes. "That went well."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Ale looked at her curiously. "How so?"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Gwen recounted how we had been swallowed by a giant worm but found a way to escape, eventually reaching the surface. Ale was genuinely surprised.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"I see. So where did you go? Unless you crossed the sea, you couldn't have come straight here."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I shook my head. "No, actually, we went back to the kingdom and managed to lure the dragon into the underworld. But I was out of commission for about a month."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Ale's eyes narrowed as he noticed my now-flesh arm. "And other sacrifices, it looks like?"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I glanced at my hand and sighed. "Yeah, after I woke up, Sumring was invaded by its Queen. She transformed into some sort of monster and tried to kill everyone."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">We fell into silence for a moment, then Ale placed his hand on my shoulder. "You tried your best. You're a good chieftain."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I smiled at him. "Thanks."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Beans then realized Rinn hadn't shown up yet and asked, "Deta, what happened to Rinn?"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I turned to Beans, and Gwen and Bluma slowly realized the same, their expressions questioning. I sighed and looked away.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"He stayed behind... to distract the Queen."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Beans and Bluma fell silent, their eyes meeting, and Gwen walked off. Ale pondered for a moment.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Deta, right?" He looked at me and lowered himself to my eye level. "Why don't you four stay with me at my place for a while? Just until we can get these people moving in the right direction, and give you all some time to process."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">I smiled gratefully. "Thank you, Ale. I think that would help."</span><hr/></p><p class="c4 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><h5 class="c7 c23" id="h.edwl5ck8lmn"><span class="c21">CHAPTER </span><span class="c21">25 </span><span class="c13 c8">                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Yearning for Home</span></h5><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">In the days that followed, we did all we could to help the town. Bluma and Gwen, known for their exceptional sword skills, were highly respected and often trained with the guards to keep themselves sharp. They even convinced me to join in on the sparring from time to time.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Beans and I, on the other hand, focused on gathering materials and helping to build or repair homes for the refugees. It was hard work, but seeing the smiles on their faces as they settled into their new homes made it all worth it. We weren’t alone in this endeavor; the townspeople came together to assist in any way they could. It was a beautiful thing to witness.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Over the course of several weeks, we managed to construct homes for some refugees, getting to know those who lived in the town: humans, Half-Elves, and even some dwarves. When we took a break, we were treated to drinks, sweets, and fruit. The refugees who decided to stay in the town even offered to help Ale on his farm, tending to the animals and fields.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">As time went by, travelers and merchants passing through the town offered to take some refugees with them to the next town over. Out of the one hundred or so people we started with, only around twenty-five to fifty remained. It was heartwarming to see them find new homes and start new lives.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Many of the mothers who had lost their husbands found new people to love and help raise their children, while the fathers who had lost their wives found comfort and support from their new communities. It was a reminder that, even in the darkest times, there is always hope.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">The rebuilding process wasn’t without challenges. There were times when we felt overwhelmed and exhausted, but we never lost sight of our goal. We knew that we were doing something important, and that kept us going.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">About five months later, everyone had found a place to live, and even we had our own homes, which had been built as a surprise. It was around sunset when I sat on the roof of my house, constructed by the townspeople. I was wearing new clothes given to me by some refugees who had joined others in making clothing for everyone. The outfit was a light red tunic with brown trimming, paired with loose brown pants, and a belt embossed with leaves.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">As the </span><span class="c5">summer</span><span class="c5"> heat began to die down </span><span class="c5">I stared</span><span class="c5"> into the </span><span class="c5">horizon</span><span class="c2">,  I sighed, and a familiar voice interrupted my thoughts. "Reminiscing about something, Leaf-Head?" It was Gwen, who had joined me on the roof with a dried piece of meat, chewing on it. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Yeah, something like that," I replied with a chuckle.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">“Well, what is it?” Gwen inquired.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I hesitated before answering. “I haven’t seen my mother for a long time now…”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Gwen swallowed and turned to me. "That's right, you do have someone waiting for you. She's probably worried about you."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I nodded. “She probably is…”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">There was a moment of silence before Gwen spoke up. "You know, if you want to see her, you should go."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I turned to Gwen and asked, "Did you mean that?" </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">She nodded, her eyes firm. "Yeah. You've been helping everyone out here. Now that the town's built, and the refugees have a place to live, you could go home. You could also give her the soul stone."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I pulled out the soul stone, which was wrapped in a thin string around my neck. The stone glowed gold in the sunlight, and I could feel the magic within, ready to bring life to something—or someone.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">“That’s true,” Gwen continued, swallowing another piece of meat. “Well, then you should go. It’s not hard to decide. Say your farewells to the people, and we’ll be off.”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I turned to her, raising an eyebrow. "We?"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Yeah, we," she said, pointing to Beans and Bluma. "Beans and Bluma are good friends, but they came along to protect their kingdom. Now that the refugees are safe, they’ve been helping out here, but they probably won’t be able to come."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Gwen looked over at Beans and Bluma, who were chatting to each other, both wearing their repaired armor. I started to speak, "And I believe that we are now--" but then the roof tiles gave out beneath Gwen, and she began to fall. I quickly reached out with my thorn whip and caught her, gently guiding her down to the ground.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Nice save," Gwen said, looking up at me. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">"Now we’re finally even." I chuckled, thinking, </span><span class="c5 c6">Well, at least I didn’t jinx myself</span><span class="c2">. But then the roof tiles beneath me cracked. "Crap," I muttered as they gave way, and I began to fall. I landed on top of Gwen with a thud, and she groaned, "Ow." I scrambled off, apologizing. "Sorry, Gwen!"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Bluma and Beans saw what happened and ran over. "Are you two okay?" Beans asked.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Gwen nodded. "Yep, just great." She looked at me with a smile. "You--"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"I owe you," I finished for her with a smile.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Beans and Bluma exchanged smiles as I told them about my plans to go home. "So, what were you two talking about?" Beans asked. Before I could respond, Gwen quickly interjected that I was thinking of leaving.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Beans and Bluma were surprised. "Oh, that's right, you have someone waiting for you, don't you?" Beans said with a smile. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I nodded, and Bluma patted my shoulder. "Go see them."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Beans agreed. "I agree. You should go see them, Deta."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">I smiled at them and thanked them, asking if they could handle things while I was gone. Beans laughed and said, "Oh, don’t worry. It’s not like a dragon’s going to show up anytime soon." We all chuckled, agreeing that we’d think about things more in the morning.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">After saying goodnight, we each entered our respective rooms. In mine, I looked around at the barren space, with only a dresser, a bed, and a window on the wall. But I smiled as I gazed at my new ironwood staff with a green gem at its top, a gift from one of the carpenters in town. As I lay down on my bed, I stared at the ceiling and slowly drifted off to sleep as the sun set, and the darkness of night took over the room.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">My mind was trapped in a dream. I saw my home, and there was Vomete in front of me, smiling. "Deta, I'm so glad you're safe," she said, patting my back before her fingers gently brushed the Soul Stone around my neck. "Notari, my old friend…"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I looked down at the Stone. "You knew them?"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Vomete gave a weak smile, shaking her head. "Not the Randeth…" Her gaze shifted back to me, the gold in her eyes shimmering. "So, how's your new family?"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">At those words, the world around us seemed to darken, shadows creeping in. I forced a smile, awkwardly. "What family?"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Suddenly, her form began to shift, her body crumbling and warping into something unrecognizable, a chaotic mass of shapes and darkness. "The one you replaced me with... You abandoned me!" Her voice twisted with the weight of accusation.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I took a step back, panic rising. "Vomete! No!" But before I could react, shadowy hands reached out from the darkness, grabbing my arms and legs, pulling me away. "Vomete! Save me!" I screamed, struggling against their grip.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">But I was dragged deeper into the dark, Vomete's voice echoing faintly as she disintegrated. "You left me…" she whispered, her words fading as I was pulled into the darkness with great speed. I screamed out for her once more, tears flooding my eyes, but then I turned—and saw a giant red eye made of fire,glaring me down as I came closer to it.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I screamed as I fell in, only to jolt awake, gasping for air. I blinked, disoriented, my Soul Stone vibrating in my chest, and realized where I was. I awoke with a gasp, the remnants of the nightmare still clinging to me. The sun was shining through my window as it began to rise, its warm rays spreading across the room, slowly pulling me from the depths of the dream. I stretched, trying to shake off the lingering fear, and left my room.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">As I passed by Beans and Bluma’s door, I noticed it was left open. With a quick glance down the hallway, I closed it gently and headed downstairs. In the kitchen, I found Beans munching on an apple and Bluma nibbling a piece of bread.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Oh, hey Deta! Sleep well?" Beans asked with his mouth full.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I smiled weakly and sat down next to the window, soaking in the warm sunlight.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Beans chuckled, noticing something. "It must have been a good sleep. The leaves on your head are pretty dark green."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Before I could respond, Gwen walked down the stairs, looking disheveled, and grabbed a piece of bread.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Beans grinned, poking fun. "Seems the bed put a spell on you."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Gwen groaned, grabbing the bread. "They're too soft."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I couldn’t help but chuckle and, trying to shake off the last echoes of my nightmare, announced, "I'm going for a walk."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Heading into the woods, I smiled as the birds chirped and the sounds of nature began to wake with the day. As I walked, I ran into two village hunters. I greeted them and asked if they had any luck with their bows.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">They showed me some quail they had caught. "These birds are everywhere this time of year," one of them said. "They taste pretty good, dried or roasted over the fire."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I smiled. "Well, you should enjoy it. You worked hard for it."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">The men seemed proud of that, exchanging glances. "We certainly will!" one said, giving a hearty nod. "Now we best be going, or we'll miss out on some more before it gets too late in the day."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">The other man chuckled. "Or our wives will have our heads." They both laughed, waved, and continued on their way.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I chuckled to myself and kept walking, the cool air of the woods surrounding me. As I moved deeper into the trees, I couldn't help but think of my home forest, with its towering oaks and birches, the small streams winding through the underbrush, and the misty mornings that always held a sense of peace.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Things were so different back then," I muttered under my breath, my thoughts drifting back to everything that had happened over the past few months. "I left home expecting to help a little girl, and got dragged into fighting a dragon, only to fall into the underworld, then come back to save the people of a fallen kingdom?"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I smiled up at the sky, shaking my head lightly. "Almost sounds like some sort of fairytale," I said, speaking to no one but the wind. "Vomete is going to love to hear this." I chuckled softly, imagining her reaction.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">As I walked deeper into the woods, my thoughts began to drift. I started to think about my home, my mother, and my friends. It had been a few months now, and I could feel a pull in my heart, a desire to return. A year had now passed since I last saw my mother, and the ache of missing her grew with each passing day.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">But then my thoughts shifted to Gwen, Bluma, and Beans. We had been through so much together already, and I knew that, no matter where I went, we would continue to support each other. Still, I wondered—was I really ready to leave them behind and return to my old life? The thought of walking away from them felt heavier than I expected.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Lost in my thoughts, I wandered deeper into the woods and suddenly found myself in a clearing. The sun had risen high enough for its light to filter through the trees, casting a golden glow that made the whole area feel almost magical. The grass was still damp with dew, and small droplets of water sparkled in the sunlight. I paused, taking it all in.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">The quiet beauty of the place filled me with peace. I took a deep breath of the cool, crisp air, feeling the warmth of the sun on my skin. Rabbits hopped past, squirrels darted from tree to tree, and even a family of foxes played in the distance. The woods were teeming with life, and it was all so perfect, so alive.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"The woods are always so... wonderful..." I whispered to myself, the memories rushing back of the time we were trapped in the Underworld. I remembered our small camp, the struggle to work together and find a way back to the surface.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">"But it would be better if I had them with me..." I thought, feeling the conflict grow within me. </span><span class="c5 c6">Should I stay with them?</span><span class="c2"> The weight of that decision felt heavy in my chest, and yet, Vomete was waiting for me, too.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">As I walked through the forest, the sound of a twig snapping behind me caught my attention. I turned around and saw </span><span class="c5">a doe with her fawn</span><span class="c2">, both moving gracefully through the underbrush. With a warm smile, I spoke softly, "Hey there, ma'am, is there something I can help you with?"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">The doe paused, chuckling lightly. "Not at all, Randeth. We were just taking our morning stroll."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Realizing my mistake, I let out a soft laugh. "Oh I see, sorry for disrupting you."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Don’t worry about it," she replied, her voice gentle. "Now, you should hurry back. I’m sure your friends are waiting for you."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">With a nod, I watched her and her fawn disappear into the trees, a smile lingering on my face as I continued my walk.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">When I returned to the village, I spotted Beans and Bluma leaving their house for their patrol. I waved and called out, "Hey, guys!" They turned, their smiles as bright as ever.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Hey, Deta! What's up?" Beans asked.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I walked over, glancing toward their gear. "Are you guys off to patrol?"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Bluma gave a slight shrug. "Perhaps," she said in her usual calm tone.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Beans chuckled, then added, "Gwen’s out in the field. Maybe you should go see what she’s up to?"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I grinned. "Sounds like a plan!"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Heading over to the field, I saw Gwen and Ale talking in the distance. As I got closer, Ale waved with a big smile, and Gwen turned around in my direction.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Hey, guys!" I greeted them. "What were you talking about?"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Ale chuckled before responding. "Gwen and I were discussing the idea of building a sparring pit in this open part of the field. It's not really being used for anything, and a sparring tournament could help lift everyone’s spirits and give them something to look forward to in the coming year."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"That sounds like a great idea!" I smiled, genuinely impressed.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Gwen gazed out into the field thoughtfully. "Yes, it does. But Bushy..." She turned to me with a playful grin. "How will we know it’s good for sparring?”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I chuckled, knowing exactly what she meant by that. Gwen and I stepped out into the open field, each of us taking a moment to stretch and warm up. I watched her grip her sword tightly, her gaze focused, determination clear in her eyes.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"You ready?" she asked, her voice steady.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I nodded, gripping my staff and getting into position. "Let's go."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">We circled each other, the quiet hum of the morning air filling the space between us. Gwen took the lead with a series of quick strikes, each one coming fast and precise. I blocked them with my staff, moving quickly to keep up. When I saw an opening, I swung at her, but she nimbly dodged and countered with a slash that grazed my shoulder.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Nice move," I said, smiling as I rubbed my shoulder. "But you're not getting past me that easily."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">She smirked, twirling her sword in one hand. "We'll see about that."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Then she lunged forward again, her strikes coming faster, more intense. I blocked and parried with everything I had, but Gwen’s strength and speed were almost overwhelming. I found myself on the defensive, focusing all my energy just to keep from being overwhelmed.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Just when I thought I couldn't hold on much longer, I spotted an opening. In one swift motion, I swung my staff with all my strength. The staff connected with the side of Gwen's sword, sending it flying from her hand and skidding across the grass.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Gwen stumbled back, surprised by the force of the blow. I stepped forward, staff poised and ready.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Looks like I won this round," I said, grinning, my heart racing.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">But before I could land the finishing blow, Gwen recovered quickly, diving forward and tackling me to the ground. We both hit the grass with a thud, and for a moment, we wrestled, each of us trying to gain the upper hand. But Gwen proved to be the stronger of the two, her knee pressing into my chest as she pinned me to the ground.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"I don't think so," she said, her grin full of mischief.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I chuckled, panting for breath. "Okay, okay, you win."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">We both stood up, brushing ourselves off with matching grins.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"That was a good one," Gwen said, retrieving her sword from where it had fallen. "But don't get too comfortable. I'm not going easy on you."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"I wouldn't have it any other way," I replied, twirling my staff in my hand, my heart still racing.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">We resumed our fighting stances, both of us prepared for the next round. As we circled each other, I couldn't help but admire Gwen's skill. Even though I’d lost this round, it was clear she was the better fighter. I had much to learn from her.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">This time, I focused more intently, trying to anticipate her moves and finding new ways to block and counter. Slowly, I started to get into the rhythm of the fight, managing to hold my ground against her flurry of strikes.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">But as the minutes passed, I could tell Gwen was becoming more aggressive. She was determined to win this round, and her attacks were coming faster and harder. I struggled to keep up with her relentless assault, my muscles growing tired as she pressed on.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I gritted my teeth, trying to stay focused, but then came a moment where I misjudged her movement. She swung her sword at me again, and this time I was too slow to block. The blade caught me on the shoulder, and I winced as a sharp pain shot through my body.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Ah!" I grunted, stepping back, my vision blurring for a moment from the intensity of the strike.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Gwen lowered her sword slightly, her eyes softening with concern. "You okay?"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I nodded, though I was clearly winded. "Yeah, just a little slow on that one. But I’m not out yet."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I stumbled backward, clutching my shoulder as Gwen advanced, a determined look in her eyes. But just as she was about to land the finishing blow, I took a deep breath and, with everything I had left, lunged forward with my staff.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">The sudden movement caught her off guard. She stumbled back, her eyes widening in surprise. I didn't hesitate. Seizing the moment, I swung my staff with all my might, striking her square in the stomach and knocking the wind out of her.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Gwen doubled over, gasping for breath, as I stood over her, panting. We both paused for a moment, catching our breath, the peacefulness of the open field wrapping around us like a warm embrace. The sun’s golden light cast long shadows across the grass, a calm contrast to the intensity of our sparring.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Let's do it again," Gwen said suddenly, her fierce determination returning to her eyes.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I grinned, the excitement of the fight still coursing through me. "You are on." I quickly healed the wound on my shoulder, ready to go again.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">This time, we both charged forward without hesitation. The intensity of our fight grew, with each of us switching between offense and defense. My body was starting to ache, but I pushed through it, focusing on landing another strike. Gwen, too, seemed to be feeling the strain, but she kept up her relentless pace.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I saw an opening and charged, but Gwen, faster than I anticipated, sidestepped and drove her knee into my gut. The force of the blow knocked me backward, and I stumbled, winded.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"You okay?" she asked, a note of concern in her voice.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I nodded, gasping for breath. "Yeah, I'm good."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">We continued to spar, but my movements were starting to slow, and I could feel the fatigue setting in. Gwen’s attacks were still sharp, but her movements, too, were becoming less precise as she wore herself out.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">After a few more exchanges, it became clear that I wasn’t going to be able to keep up much longer. Finally, Gwen called a halt to the fight, stepping back and raising her hands.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"You did well," she said, giving me a respectful nod. "But you need to work on your endurance."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I nodded, my chest heaving as I tried to catch my breath. Even though I’d lost, a sense of pride filled me. I had lasted longer than I thought I would.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Nice job, you two," Ale's voice came from behind us. We turned to see him walking toward us, a smile on his face. "That was quite the spar. But you should head home now. It's getting late, and it takes time to get back."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I smiled at Ale. "Fair point. It was great to see you, Ale!" He rolled his eyes playfully but smiled back.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Ya, ya, now get!" he chuckled, waving us off.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">As Gwen and I walked back, we chatted easily, the tension from the sparring session fading. But then Gwen asked, "Have you decided yet?"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I didn’t answer immediately, my thoughts still caught in the whirlwind of my decision. "Not really, no."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Gwen sighed, her voice taking on a hint of exasperation. "Of course. You know you have a problem."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I glanced at her, confused. "A problem?"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Yes," she said, her tone soft but firm, placing a hand on my shoulder. "It's that you're thinking too hard. Just do what you need to do and stop thinking about it."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Her words were simple, but they struck me with surprising clarity. "You can't keep living in this state of indecision," she continued. "You need to make a choice and stick with it."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I nodded, realizing what she was talking about. "I know, I just don't know which choice is the right one."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Gwen stopped walking and turned to face me, her expression serious. "Bushy, there is no right or wrong choice. It's about what you want, what you need, and what will make you happy. You need to trust yourself and make a decision that feels right for you."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I looked at her, slightly surprised by her giving advice and not being blunt "But what if I make the wrong choice? What if I regret it?"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Gwen sighed and gave a soft reassuring smile. "If you make a decision that doesn't turn out the way you wanted, it's not the end of the world. You can always change your mind and try something else. The important thing is that you take action and move forward."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I nodded, taking in her words. "You're right. I need to stop second-guessing myself and take a leap of faith."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Gwen squeezed my shoulder. "Exactly."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I smiled, feeling lighter, like something had been lifted from my chest. "Thank you, Gwen. I needed to hear that."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">She grinned, teasing, "Good, because never again! Can't believe you make me do the support role. Yuck!" We both laughed as we walked toward the house.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Inside, Beans and Bluma were slouched in chairs, looking exhausted. Gwen smirked at them. "Tired much?" </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Beans rolled his eyes, unamused. "Haha, very funny."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Gwen chuckled. "Alright. I'm off to bed. Later." She made her way up the stairs.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"She's going to bed early," I remarked, but neither Beans nor Bluma seemed to hear. I shrugged and added, "And I think that's not a bad idea for the two of you."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">That made them smile, and they nodded in agreement before heading upstairs.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">I walked over to the chair by the window, sinking into it as I looked out at the fading sunlight. A cool evening breeze gently swept through the room, and I let out a quiet sigh. </span><span class="c5 c6">Should I stay? Or go…?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">The next morning, when I woke up, I felt a sense of clarity I hadn’t had before. It was time to pack my bags and head back home. The decision had been gnawing at me for days, but with Gwen’s words in my heart, I knew I had to go back to Vomete and make sure she was okay, at the very least.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I gathered my clothes and folded them carefully, packing only the essentials. As I worked, memories of my time with Gwen and the others flowed through me— the laughter, the adventures, the struggles, and the moments of pure joy. They had all become treasured pieces of my life. Once I finished and had my new bag packed, everything felt right. It was time.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I stepped out of my room, my heart heavy with the thought of telling them, but I hadn’t expected to find the three of them already gathered at the bottom of the stairs, each with a bag of their own.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">“Guys?” I asked, surprised.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Beans was the first to speak, grinning wide. “What? Think we were gonna let you have all the fun out there?”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Gwen followed with a smirk, her eyes glinting with mischief. “You took too long deciding, now you’re stuck with us, Leaf-head.” She shot me a grin.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">A warm feeling spread through me, and I couldn’t help but smile at my friends. We hadn’t needed any words beyond that; we were in this together. We made our farewells and then stepped outside, heading toward the path that would lead us back home. Despite the uncertainty of what lay ahead, there was a sense of peace in knowing that I wasn’t walking that path alone.</span><hr/></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><h5 class="c7 c23" id="h.2p2csry"><span class="c21">CHAPTER 26</span><span class="c13 c8">                                                                                                                                                                                                                     An Empty Journey</span></h5><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">As we began to leave town, a voice called out behind us. "Hey! Wait up!"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">We stopped and turned to see a Dwarven man running toward us, holding something in his hands. Beans stepped forward, meeting him halfway. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Is something wrong?" he asked. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">The two of them began speaking in Dwarvish, their conversation unfolding in quick exchanges. As they spoke, Beans' face shifted through a range of emotions—surprise, curiosity, and something I couldn't quite place. Finally, the Dwarven man gave a respectful salute, said something we assumed was a farewell, then turned and strode back toward town.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">When Beans faced us again, he was met with expectant stares. Gwen crossed her arms, one brow raised. "Care to let us in?"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">He smiled, holding up the item the Dwarf had given him—a map. "He gave us this," he explained. "A map of this region. It'll help us get back to the kingdom faster."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Gwen's expression flickered with something unreadable before settling into mild surprise. "Back to the kingdom? We're actually going?"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I nodded. "The portal I used to get here is just a day's walk away."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">She took that in with a slow nod, then fell into step beside us as we resumed our journey. Beans took the lead, eyes flicking between the map and the path ahead. As we re-entered the woods, a smile tugged at my lips. There was something so familiar about the sight of Beans scrutinizing a map while the dim light filtered through the trees.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Gwen caught my expression and tilted her head. "What's funny?"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I chuckled. "It all feels like déjà vu. Like when we were in the Underworld."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Recognition flashed across her face, and she grinned. "Yeah, I remember that. It was quite a ride."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">We pressed on, weaving through towering trees and stepping over tangled roots. The forest was peaceful, filled with the soft rustle of leaves and the distant chirping of birds. Then, without warning, a deafening roar shattered the quiet.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">We froze. My pulse pounded in my ears as the ground trembled beneath us. From the underbrush, two massive creatures emerged—bears, but not like any I had ever seen. Their bodies were covered in sleek feathers, and as they reared up, enormous wings unfurled, spanning over twenty feet wide.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Weapons drawn, we braced ourselves as the beasts circled, their growls vibrating through the air. For a tense moment, neither side moved. Gwen broke the silence, her gaze locked on the feathered bears.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"What do you think they want?" she asked.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I hesitated. "They're looking for their next meal."</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">A mischievous glint flashed in her eyes. "Well, let's not keep them waiting then!"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Bluma and Beans shifted into more aggressive stances as Gwen and I stepped forward, weapons ready. With a shared battle cry, we launched into the fight, each pair taking on one of the winged beasts.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">The first bear lunged at us, a massive paw swiping toward my side. I countered with a swift strike of my staff, knocking its limb downward. The force of the impact sent its own claws raking into its leg, tripping it to the ground. Gwen seized the opening, slashing down with her sword, but the bear flared its wings and beat them with a powerful gust. The blast hurled us backward, sending me tumbling across the dirt.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">With a snarl, the creature reared onto its hind legs and bellowed, "I'm going to enjoy killing you!"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I met its glare without flinching. "I'm not dying today!"</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Before it could strike again, I shifted into my Celeste elk form, surging forward with antlers lowered.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Meanwhile, Bluma and Beans battled the other bear. As it swiped at Bluma, she ducked and hoisted Beans onto its back. He scrambled up to the base of its wings, dark energy coiling around his hands. The feathers beneath his grip blackened, rotting away as decay spread through the creature’s flesh.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">The bear roared and reared onto its hind legs, trying to shake him off. Beans leaped free just in time, landing in a crouch.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Bluma!" he shouted.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">She was already moving. Sprinting forward, she drove her glowing white sword deep into the bear’s side. The beast howled in agony, its massive form shuddering under the force of the strike.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">The Flying Bear flared its wings, forcing Bluma to dodge, but in doing so, she left Beans exposed. A powerful wing smacked into him, sending him stumbling backward. Before he could recover, the bear spun and struck him with a heavy paw, launching him off his feet. He hit the ground hard, skidding several feet away.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Bluma tightened her grip on her sword as the bear turned its attention to her, roaring loud enough to shake the trees. She held her ground, eyes locked onto the beast, ready for its next move.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I charged, but the bear let out a deafening roar and caught my antlers, using them as leverage to throw me off balance. Its jaws clamped around my neck, crushing down with terrifying force before it hurled me to the ground. Pain exploded through me as cracks splintered across my stone-like skin. The pressure was too much—I reverted to my natural form, clutching my neck in agony.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Bushy, get up!" Gwen stood in front of me, sword drawn. Above her, the bear spread its wings and lifted off the ground. "Get up now!" she snapped.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I forced myself upright just as the beast dove toward us. Gripping my staff, I swung with all my strength, striking it square in the face. The impact sent it careening off course—straight into the other bear. The two collided midair and crashed to the ground in a tangled heap of wings and limbs.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Bluma wasted no time, sprinting toward Beans and hauling him up. Without hesitation, we followed her as she bolted northward.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"These things fly?!" Gwen shouted between breaths.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Yes, and they're fast!" I panted.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">The bears roared behind us, their massive forms lifting into the air once more. Shadows passed over us as they soared above the treetops, closing the distance at an alarming speed.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">"Very fast!" I called out.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">The Flying Bears caught up to us in no time, forcing Gwen to spin around and draw her glowing red sword. With a fierce swing, she sent a slash of fire hurtling toward them. The flames struck, momentarily blinding the beasts.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">As they regained their sight, their heads whipped around in confusion. Growling and grunting to each other, they searched for us. One took off into the sky, while the other, its wings scorched and wounded, landed heavily on the ground. It let out a low rumble, sniffing the air, trying to catch our scent.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Bluma and Beans had taken refuge in the branches of a nearby tree, while Gwen and I crouched low behind the underbrush. The bear let out a guttural roar as it locked onto our scent and went still.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Gwen caught my eye from her hiding spot and signaled. I gave a small nod, then reached for a decent-sized rock. With careful aim, I tossed it toward a bush a little ahead of us.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">The bear’s head snapped toward the rustling sound. It reared onto its hind legs and came crashing down, trampling the bush beneath its massive weight. When it found nothing there, it spun back around—only to see Gwen and me standing behind it, weapons drawn.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">It let out a furious roar and charged.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Before it could reach us, Bluma and Beans dropped from the tree, plunging their weapons deep into its back and wing. The bear howled in agony, staggering under the sudden assault. Blood soaked its feathers, its movements growing sluggish.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Bluma and Beans leapt clear just as Gwen slashed her sword through the air. Another wave of fire struck the bear, igniting its feathers and forcing it into a panicked frenzy. It swung wildly, blinded by pain, but I seized the opening. With a sharp strike of my staff, I slammed its head downward, forcing it to crash onto the ground. A second blow sent it hurtling into a tree.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Gwen and Bluma didn’t hesitate. They lunged forward, driving their swords deep into its side. The bear let out one final, shuddering growl before collapsing, motionless.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">After a brief moment of rest, we heard the other bear’s roar in the distance, drawing nearer. We quickly sprinted northward, eventually spotting a small cavern covered in moss. It was just big enough for us to fit, but far too small for the Flying Bear to enter.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">“Get in here!” Beans called out, slipping inside first. He’d spotted the cavern before we did. Gwen and I had already passed it, so we had to quickly backtrack. Bluma was next, slipping inside just as the Flying Bear landed and charged toward us with terrifying speed.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">“Crap, crap, crap!” Gwen muttered, darting inside. I hesitated, turning to look back as the bear was hot on my heels.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">“Bushy!” Gwen called out, glancing behind her as the bear closed in on me.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">The bear was much faster than I was. It quickly caught up, and in a panic, I veered behind a tree. The bear, too large to make the sharp turn, slowed for a moment. But that brief respite wasn’t enough—its powerful stride soon closed the distance again.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c6">Frick! I’m gonna die! What should I do?</span><span class="c2"> I thought, my mind racing as the bear roared, “Stop running! It won’t save you!”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">Then, an idea hit me. I made a sharp turn, transformed into my </span><span class="c5">Celestial</span><span class="c2"> Elk form, and charged toward the cave entrance. The bear cursed, its pursuit faltering as I gained ground. My heart pounded as I approached the entrance, my hooves thundering on the ground.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Once I reached the cave, I shifted back to my natural form, sliding into the crevice just in time to avoid the bear’s grasp.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">As I ventured deeper into the cavern, it opened into a large chamber, and I stumbled, falling to the ground.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">“Bushy!” Gwen and the others rushed over, helping me up.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">“I’m okay. I made it...” I said, catching my breath.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Beans grinned. “Good job, Deta, but you need to rest before you pass out.”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">They eased me against the cave wall, and Gwen settled beside me. “Yeah, that’s probably a good idea,” I chuckled, relieved.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Bluma smiled but turned toward the entrance as the Flying-Bear roared once more. “How long?” she asked.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Beans sighed. “Maybe an hour or so before it leaves.”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I shook my head. “No, they hold grudges. We’ll have to wait until it falls asleep and try to sneak out then.”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Gwen groaned. “Of course. Well, we might as well rest.”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">We all nodded in agreement and took our seats. Beans, however, began rummaging through his pack.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">“Deta, could you use your magic to make some branches or something grow here?” he asked.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Smiling, I raised my hand, coaxing a cluster of roots from the ground until they reached about five feet high.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">“What are you doing?” I asked, curious.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">“Collecting fuel,” he explained. “If we’re stuck here overnight, we might need a fire to stay warm.”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">“Let </span><span class="c2">me help,” I offered, attempting to stand, but Gwen quickly pulled me back down.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">“No, you’re staying right here until it’s time to leave,” she said firmly.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I frowned. “Why?”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">We went back and forth for a moment before she finally asked, “Did you fix your neck?”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">The question caught me off guard, but I admitted it would take a few hours.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">She crossed her arms. “And you made it worse by running around.”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I sighed, knowing she was right, and slumped back against the wall in reluctant defeat.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">As Beans continued gathering roots, I caught Bluma watching us, a small smile playing on her lips.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Hours passed, and night finally fell. Beans, the smallest among us, had the easiest time squeezing through the entrance. He slipped outside, returning moments later with a silent signal— the Flying-Bear was asleep.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">One by one, we crept out, Bluma leading the way, followed by Gwen, and then me. The others waited patiently as I struggled to squeeze through, our height difference making it a tight fit.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Once we were all out, we quietly slipped away, careful not to wake the sleeping bear. Only when we had put a good distance between ourselves and the cave did we finally relax, smiles spreading across our faces.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">“Well, that was a close one,” I chuckled.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Gwen laughed. “Pshh, please. We had him right where we wanted him. You were the one in trouble!”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Beans grinned. “Oh yeah, you were the only one struggling.”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">We stifled our laughter as we joked about the danger we had just escaped. A cool breeze brushed against our faces, and I felt my body begin to relax, my eyelids growing heavy. Gwen stretched with a yawn, and Beans, mid-yawn himself, attempted to speak.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">“We… gotta… stay awake,” he mumbled before shaking his head with a laugh. “We’re not out of danger yet.”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Gwen smirked. “Ten copper says you’re the first to fall asleep, Bushy.”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I grinned. “Fifteen says it’s Beans.”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Beans turned, looking appalled. “Now hold on a minute—”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">We burst into laughter and continued our journey, doing our best to fight off exhaustion.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">As the night wore on, we shared stories and jokes to keep ourselves entertained, but the struggle to stay awake became harder with every passing moment. The cool breeze, the rhythmic chirping of crickets, and the gentle murmur of a nearby stream worked against us, lulling us toward sleep.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Eventually, we couldn’t resist any longer. Telling ourselves it was only a short break, we settled against the trees—and before we knew it, sleep took us.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">The warmth of the morning sun stirred me first. Blinking my eyes open, I found Beans and Bluma leaning against each other, sound asleep. Gwen, however, had somehow ended up collapsed on my lap.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">It took a moment for my groggy brain to register what I was seeing. And when it did, I froze.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c6">If I wake her up, would she punch me? …Probably.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Before I could decide, Gwen shifted, stirring from sleep. Panicking, I squeezed my eyes shut, hoping she’d think I was still asleep.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I felt her move—rubbing her eyes, stretching—and then, her hand brushed against my face before quickly retreating. There was a brief pause, followed by the faint swish of movement. I could only guess that she was waving a hand in front of my face, testing if I’d react.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">A moment later, I heard her rummaging through her bag. Then something soft draped over me. I listened as her footsteps retreated into the woods. When I finally dared to peek, </span><span class="c5">I saw a blanket covering me.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">A small smile crept onto my face. The fabric was warm, soft… and faintly smelled like Gwen.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c6">…that… is as weird as it sounded</span><span class="c5">.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I found myself drifting back to sleep, only to be jolted awake when the blanket was suddenly yanked off me.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I jumped with a small yelp, my heart racing. Standing in front of me, grinning, was Gwen.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">“Thought you were dead, Bushy. You’re usually one of the first to wake up,” she teased as she folded the blanket.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Blinking the sleep from my eyes, I realized I was now the last one up—a stark contrast from earlier. Beans and Bluma were already on their feet, studying the map and discussing our next move.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I chuckled. “Guess I was just really tired.” Stretching, I took a deep breath—only to pause as an unfamiliar scent reached me.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">“…Do you guys smell that?” I asked, frowning.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Beans and Bluma looked up and sniffed the air.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">“Oh,” Beans said, his expression shifting. “There’s a fire in the distance.” He stepped aside, pushing back the branches of a bush to reveal a clearing. Sure enough, a plume of smoke rose into the sky.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">“Bluma and I figured out a way around it,” he added. “That was the direction we were heading, but we should still reach the kingdom by the end of the day.”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Although the fire made me uneasy, I smiled and nodded. “Alright, well, we should get moving. Don’t want that bear catching up to us.”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Beans chuckled. “Good point.”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Bluma smiled. “Let’s go.”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">As we continued walking along the edge of the forest and the open field, we encountered minimal problems. Still, I couldn’t shake the uneasy feeling gnawing at me about the fire.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Listening closely, I let the trees whisper their knowledge. They told me a small cottage in the woods had been raided, and part of the forest was burning—but it would be fine. A rainstorm was on its way.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Curious, I asked how they knew about the storm.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c6">We heard it </span><span class="c5 c6">through the grapevine</span><span class="c5 c6">,</span><span class="c2"> they replied.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I couldn't help but chuckle, and the trees joined in.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Gwen, noticing my laughter, raised an eyebrow. “Who are you even talking to, Leaf-head?”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">“Oh, you know, the trees,” I said casually.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">She rolled her eyes. “Oh, of course! I should’ve known!” Her sarcasm made me chuckle even more.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">We walked on for a while until, in the distance, I spotted a black spire piercing the sky.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">“Hey, Beans, look up,” I said, grinning as I placed a hand on his shoulder.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">As he followed my gaze, his eyes widened. “I think that’s the kingdom!”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Excitement lit his face as he quickly rolled up the map and took off running. Gwen and I exchanged a smile before dashing after him.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">“Race you!” Gwen grinned.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I laughed. “You’re on!”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">We sprinted ahead, leaving Beans behind—but before he could protest about the unfair disadvantage of our height difference, Bluma swooped in, scooped him up, and carried him along.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Despite everything, we were smiling as we ran. Even though we knew what awaited us—the destruction, the devastation—we still allowed ourselves this fleeting moment of happiness. It meant something.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">As the kingdom came into view, our pace slowed. The excitement in our chests faded into something heavier. We arrived at the stables' entrance at the back of the kingdom, catching our breath before stepping inside the city walls.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">The devastation was immediate.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Small flames still smoldered in the ruins.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">The grand, towering structures that once stood proud had crumbled into piles of rubble and ash. Charred buildings and shattered walls lined the streets, their remains scattered in jagged heaps. The air was thick with the acrid scent of smoke and burnt wood, and the ground beneath our feet was darkened with soot.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Everything had been reduced to little more than crumbling ruins and burnt-out shells. The once-bustling streets now stood empty and silent, the only sounds the whispering wind and the echoes of a life that no longer existed. The few surviving structures were barely standing, their walls scorched, their roofs melted by the intense heat of the fire. The grand gates that once guarded the kingdom had collapsed into twisted metal and molten stone.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">As we moved deeper into the ruins, I could see the pain in Bluma’s and Beans’ faces. This was the place they had sworn to protect.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Beans let out a heavy sigh. “We should go. There’s nothing left for us here.”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">He turned to Bluma, who nodded in agreement. Gwen and I shared a sorrowful glance before following them toward the kingdom’s front gates. We each took one last look back, paying silent respects to what had once been, before stepping away from the wreckage of the past.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">As we walked, I hesitated before asking, “Are you two doing okay?”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">To my surprise, Beans managed a small smile. “We’ll be fine. My parents are safe, the people are safe, and Bluma and I still have each other. We’ve faced worse.”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Bluma nodded. “Yes. We will be fine.”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I returned their smile, and Gwen offered her condolences.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">As we continued, something caught my eye—a scorched trail stretching in the same direction we were heading. My stomach twisted.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Then, I saw it.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">The flower field.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">The vast meadow that lay between the kingdom and my home.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">But instead of a sea of vibrant colors swaying in the wind, all I saw was devastation. A wave of shock, grief, and despair crashed over me.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Gwen must have noticed my sudden change in demeanor. “Bushy, what’s wrong—?”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Before she could finish, my body moved on its own. I shifted into my Celestial Elk form and bolted.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">“Bushy!!”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">Their shouts faded behind me, but I couldn’t stop. I </span><span class="c5 c6">wouldn’t</span><span class="c2"> stop.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">The trees had told me about the raided cottage. The fire.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">And now, I had to see it for myself.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">After thirty minutes of running as fast as I could, the portal came into view. Gwen and the others' cries had long since faded, swallowed by the distance.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I lunged forward, shifting back into my natural form mid-air. "Exitum!" I roared. The portal flared to life, and before my feet touched the ground, I was already through—stepping straight into a nightmare.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">The house was gone.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">All that remained was a skeleton of blackened beams and collapsing rubble, flames still licking hungrily at the ruins. Ash choked the air, thick and acrid, burning my throat with every breath. My home—our home—was nothing but smoldering wreckage.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">“Vomete!” I screamed, my voice splitting the night.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I tore through the burning wreckage, my stone skin blistering against the heat, the vines of my hair shriveling from the smoke. Embers rained down, searing my shoulders, but I didn’t stop. I couldn’t stop.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Then I saw it—a hand.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Pale stone, tangled in scorched vines, reaching from beneath a collapsed beam.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">“Mom!”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I stumbled forward, my hands shaking as I grasped the burning wood and heaved. My muscles strained, my breath ragged, but I didn’t stop until the beam crashed aside.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">She lay beneath it.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">Her body—once strong, once full of life—was withered and broken. The vines of her hair were dry, brittle, their once-deep green reduced to crumbling black. And her chest—where her Soul S</span><span class="c5">tone</span><span class="c2"> should have been—was empty.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">“No, no, no…” I choked out, gathering her into my arms. Her stone skin was cooling, her weight unfamiliar without the steady hum of life beneath it. “Vomete, please, wake up.”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">For a moment, there was nothing. Then her chest lifted, barely. A shallow, trembling breath.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">“Deta…” Her voice was fragile, thinner than the wind. “You’re alive…”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">“I’m here.” I brushed soot from her face, my tears streaking through the grime. “Don’t talk, save your strength—”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">She weakly shook her head, a feeble hand rising to touch my cheek. “Listen to me.”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Outside, the sky finally opened, and rain poured through the shattered roof. The fire hissed in protest, steam curling through the air.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">“You’ve made me proud,” she murmured. “But my time… is over.”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">“No.” My grip tightened, desperate. “No, don’t say that.” I then took the soul stone around my neck and tried to put it inside her gap. Vomete grabbed my hands with her trembling ones.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">A faint, broken smile. “Shh. Remember… Be kind. No matter the cost. It will light even the darkest paths.”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Her voice was fading.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">“And… cherish your time. Follow your dreams… even when it hurts.”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">“Vomete, please—” My voice shattered.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">“You carry my love, always.” Her eyes softened, looking past me, past the ruin, toward something I couldn’t see. “Tachi’guf’s angel… they gave me you. And I thank them…”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">The breath left her lips.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">She stilled in my arms.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">For a moment, there was nothing but the rain—dampening the last embers, washing away the soot. My chest caved in on itself, a soundless sob breaking from my throat. “No…” My voice barely made it past my lips. “Vomete!.. Mom… please…”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Footsteps. The portal shimmered behind me as Gwen and the others stepped through.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Their movements slowed as they took in the devastation. Gwen stopped first, her hand gripping the frame of the ruined doorway. Beans, for once, was silent. Bluma lingered behind them, unreadable.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">“Was that… his mother?” Beans asked, voice hushed.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Gwen nodded but didn’t speak.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">No one did.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I barely noticed their whispers. My world had shrunk to the weight in my arms, the cold settling into her skin.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">“Go away,” I whispered. My voice cracked. “Please… just go.”</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">There was silence. Then—hesitant footsteps. Someone knelt beside me, only to withdraw just as quickly.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">I didn’t look up, but when I finally did, Gwen was gone. In her place, beside me on the scorched floor, was a small plush. A simple, familiar creature from the underworld.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">My fingers trembled as I reached for it, pressing the soft fabric to my chest. Pressing it against Vomete’s lifeless form.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">The weight of everything crushed me. The memories clawed at my mind—her voice, her warmth, the way she used to hum as she combed through my vines. She had always been there. </span><span class="c5">When I scraped my knees</span><span class="c2">. When the nights were too dark. When I needed her most.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">And now she was gone.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Her last words echoed in my mind, but they meant nothing. Not yet. The why didn’t matter. The loss was unbearable.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Whoever did this… they would pay.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">But not now. Not yet.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">My body finally gave in. I collapsed, lost in grief, and the world faded away.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">I woke to pale morning light seeping through a smoke-stained window. Outside, the little stream trickled softly, the birds already singing. The storm had passed.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">As if the world hadn’t just ended.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">The air smelled of damp ash and charred wood. My vines had curled, dried at the edges, as if mourning with me. A faint breeze stirred them, carrying the last ghost of warmth from the fire.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">For a moment, I just sat there, staring at nothing.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Then the memories came crashing down.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">My chest ached. My fingers curled around the plush in my palm.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Whoever did this… I would find them.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">But not yet.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">My legs wouldn’t move. My heart was too heavy.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">For now, all I could do was sit there, alone, as the echoes of her voice faded into the morning.</span><hr/></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c8 c14 c22 c58">To Be Continued…</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c8 c14 c22 c31">[]  XB CQ-J-J&amp;R;’...</span></p><hr/><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c50 c8 c14 c22"></span></p><hr/><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c50 c8 c14 c22"></span></p><h4 class="c7 c23" id="h.6fkmdj598ckd"><span class="c32">About the author</span></h4><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span><img alt="" src="images/image1.jpg" title=""/></span></p><p class="c12 c9"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c2">Caleb Jones began the creation of the world of Entine in 2016 and has been writing since 2021.
