Whispers have her marked as the Red Devil, her skill in combat is nearly unmatch by any human she has ever faced. Known only to have been beaten by her General. (Which was by complete accident)  Bluma is known to only speak to select few people and when she does speak it is only in one worded sentances. However These two are so close a siple sigh or gesture from her will allow Beans to know exactly what she is thiking or wants to say.

While Bluma can be found by the streams outside the castle walls, soaking her feet and staring into the unknown. however she is never seen without her sword or some kind of armor. This picture was painted the day she finished training her squire Beans. That has been the only day any have known her to outwordly show her emotions. Some say that day, her pride was so palpable, it could be felt by all who were near her. Others say that day, she was so happy, she was glowing. But the truth is, she was just happy to have a friend who wasnt scared of her. Art by <a href='https://www.facebook.com/xy.pauig' target='_blank'>Zeph Pauig</a>"
