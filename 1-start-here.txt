Hello grader! Pleasure to have you here in my little project! 

This is my Entine Calculator, as ylu may or may not know I am a published author!

I have released my first book on amazon titled: " Entine: Quest For the Soul Stone"

This will be a HUGE work in progress for a long time coming as i continue to build and create!

This site includes many things such as a language translator, Age convertor, 
combat generator, an error list of things needing fixing, a cast list and much more to come!

The Library is still underway as i have not written all the books yet, however you can find
my first book ready to be read in there! If you can find the password in the code hehe

Now to see this program in its full glory! I would recommend running it with five-server
and opening it at the "Home-page.html" and feel free to explore! 

However if you want to simply grade it and be done with it, you may just go to the 
"School Creadit" folder, however it is also acsessible to see what it does 
with running the server.

I do hope you enjoy!
