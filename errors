35. Error: Translation data not cached.
    - Description: The application repeatedly fetches the same translation file instead of caching it, causing unnecessary network requests.
    - How to fix: Implement caching for translation data to reduce redundant network requests.

36. Error: User input contains unsupported special characters.
    - Description: The user input includes special characters (e.g., emojis or symbols) that are not supported by the translation logic.
    - How to fix: Add logic to handle or strip unsupported special characters from the input.
